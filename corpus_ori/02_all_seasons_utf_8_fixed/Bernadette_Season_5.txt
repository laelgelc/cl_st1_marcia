You jerk face! What did you tell Howard? Did you
say there was something going on between us? Because he
thinks there is. He’s completely freaking out!
What the hell is wrong with you?
I’m nice to everyone.
Damn right, you’re sorry. And you tell Howard there’s never
been anything between us.
What?!
Of course you do. You’re a cutie pie. Any girl
would be lucky to have you.
It’s okay if he wants to come.
What are you going to get at the train store,
Sheldon?
That’s pretty big talk for a man with a closet
full of magic tricks at his mother’s house.
Why would I keep clothes at your mother’s house?
Is she moving out?
Hang on. You seriously think I’m going to live with
your mother?
I’m not gonna live with your mother. Not now, not
ever.
Raj, take me home.
Take me home now.
Hey. I don’t want to fight. I was just surprised
when you sprung the whole living-with-your-mom stuff on me.
And your mom would be okay with that?
Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Does your mother always cut your
meat for you?
I’m okay, Mrs. Wolowitz.
Oh, God.
Okay.
No. I need to brush my teeth, but your mother’s
been in the bathroom for, like, an hour.
No, it’s not. I’m not going in there.
Good morning, handsome.
It’s me.
Your mom and I made you breakfast.
Yeah, I guess. We’re very different people, Howard, so communication’s
a little tricky.
He didn’t try them yet!
It’s butter-flavoured syrup.
He wants butter!
I just told him that!
If you want butter, I’ll get you butter.
We went cake-tasting yesterday. Raj came along. He cried and
ate half the samples.
You know, I met a really cute girl at work.
She’s married to a guy in one of our drug
trials.
Yeah, but her husband is in serious congestive heart failure,
and a little birdie told me he’s in the placebo
group.
Howie, that’s wonderful! Congratulations!
Hang on a second. NASA doesn’t have a shuttle any
more. How are you going to get up there?
Are those Russian rockets safe?
Fine. Just a little tired.
I always catch your drift.
I just can’t believe you signed up for the space
program without even talking to me.
Just stop talking, Howard.
What did you think was going to happen?
Howard.
Yeah, I get it. I just wish you included me
in the decision. We’re supposed to be partners. We’re supposed
to be a team.
Okay.
Well, first of all, thank you for including me in
the decision-making process.
No.
No.
Howard, my father was a police officer. We never knew
from one night to the next if he was going
to come home alive. It was horrible. And I don’t
want to live that way with you.
Oh, boo-hoo, you’re not going to space!
Howard?
No, I’ve just been thinking. It doesn’t matter if I’m
afraid for your safety. I don’t want to be the
person who stands between you and your dreams.
Really. If going into space means that much to you,
I will never say another word about it.
I love you.
Okay. I just forgot to brush my teeth. I’ll be
right back.
I’m ready.
I had no choice. I had to tell his mother.
He can’t go to space. He’s like a baby bird.
Do you know he once got an asthma attack from
reading an old library book?
I don’t know what I’m going to do. I don’t
want to break up over this.
Do you guys think it was a mistake? Am I
the bad guy in this?
Oh, God, you’re right. I took our love and threw
it under his bus-sized mother. I need to apologize.
What?
I do, with all my heart.
Can we talk?
All right. I just wanted to tell you I’m sorry
I said something to your mother.
I know. I’m sorry. I got scared.
I know.
Really? You got seasick on Pirates of the Caribbean.
I just did what I did because I love you
so much, and the thought of losing you is more
than I can handle.
You’re my soul mate. This is where you kiss me.
Who is it?
Hi, Sheldon.
Oh, my God, Howard! What did you do?
Howard has a heart condition! You know that!
This is adrenaline, we’re gonna have to inject it into
his heart.
You are. I’m not strong enough to get it through
his chest plate, and we’ve only got one shot.
Hurry! We’re running out of time!
Just do it!
Well, if you don’t mind looking like an orange traffic
cone, great.
Really?
That’s horrible.
I don’t know. Dead people’s dresses?
Oh, me.
That’s so sweet.
I told you that would happen.
She keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid traditions in
other cultures, and they’re all about getting naked and washing
each other.
We thought it would be easier to look at dresses
one time without her. I feel terrible.
Oh, Howie.
Oh, you know, just pillow talk. You guys have nothing
to worry about.
Yes, absolutely fine.
Hello.
We can go down to the Korean baths and do
that thing you were talking about where we wash each
other.
Amy, we’re really sorry.
Amy, you’re not a tumour. Penny, tell her she’s not
a tumour.
We know you’re upset, and you have every right to
be, but if it’s okay with you, we’d like a
second chance to make things right.
Which is why it would mean so much if you
would agree to be the maid of honour at my
wedding.
No. I, I want you to be the maid of
honour.
So is that a yes?
We’re just trying on dresses, do we really need to
record this?
I am the bride.
I love it!
Oh, Amy! Looking sexy!
Thank you.
I specialize in microorganisms, and Amy studies brains.
Come back in, Sheldon, he’s not going to hurt you.
He looks friendly. I think he might be someone’s pet.
Oh, he’s a sweetie.
Look how sweet he is. Come over and say hi.
Come on. You can do it. Don’t be scared. Come
on. Oh, just pet the bird, you big baby!
Oh, it’s just like my grandma with her parrot. And
after she lost her marbles with her remote control.
I still think he looks like someone’s pet. Maybe we
should put up posters.
I didn’t have any.
Amy, really? Twister?
I’m too small for Twister. And roller coasters. And sitting
with my feet on the floor. Hope you enjoyed the
prenatal cigarettes, Mom.
Hi. It’s Stuart. We met at the comic book store.
I was wondering if you’d like to get coffee sometime.
It’s okay if you say no. It might be the
kick in the pants I need to start taking Zoloft.
What are you going to do? Doesn’t he know you
have a boyfriend?
Well, yeah, I guess they’re not engaged like me and
Howie.
We should play limbo next. No one beats me at
limbo.
Looks like it’s just us playing. Penny? Penny, we’re out
of wine!
I love this dress. How come I never see you
wear it?
Oh, they all went with Leonard to confront his childhood
bully.
I don’t think I can meet the girl who was
always mean to me. Tammy Bodnick. One time while I
was in gym class, she stole all my clothes and
left an elf costume in my locker.
Worst part was, it was too big.
What about you?
Oh, my God, that’s awful.
Kind of sounds like you were. And maybe a felon.
You’re doing great.
Penny, it doesn’t matter what you did in the past.
You’re a good person now.
You’ll feel better by doing something nice for someone.
Every other week I serve at a soup kitchen downtown.
What about helping people?
I think Mother Teresa would have washed the clothes first.
Donated.
Penny.
I don’t feel good about this.
God, they’re cute. Oh, why did they have to be
cute?
It’s okay, I serve soup to poor people!
Oh, you have a lot of magic stuff.
Did it work?
Ooh. I like the fabric. Where’d she get it?
Listen, Howie, maybe I’m not the best choice to be
a magician’s assistant.
You know, i-it’s just that I’m not that comfortable with
little kids.
Mmm, yeah, sure.
Oh, ah, right. And now, the great Howdini’s next miraculous
illusion.
After you’ve been thoroughly amazed.
Well, you’re not getting cake right now, capisce?
Do you know how to pipe down?
You got wax in your ears? The man said it’s
an ordinary pitcher. Howdini.
That’s it. No cake for you. Anyone else want to
join the No Cake Club?
Not him.
I told you I’m not good with kids.
The thing is, my mother worked full-time. I had to
take care of my brothers and sisters.
Ugh, it was horrible. With their snotty noses and their
poopy diapers and their little shrieky voices, always complaining. I
don’t want to get dressed. Joey keeps spitting in my
mouth. This isn’t the way Mom makes waffles. Well, okay,
put your hand in here. Let’s see how you like
this waffle!
I’m sorry. I know it makes me sound like a
bad person, but I just don’t like children.
Right, when it’s our kid that’s ruined my body and
kept me up all night and I’ve got no career
and no future and nothing to be happy about for
the next 20 years, sure, that’ll be completely different.
Here’s your vest back.
Where?
I guess you talked to your mom, huh?
Look, it’s obvious having kids is really important to you,
and I think I came up with a solution.
Well, seeing as how I make way more money than
you anyway, what if I work and you stay home
with the kids?
Yeah. You know, you’ll watch Barney and pull Cheerios out
of their noses and go on play dates, and I’ll
work and have conversations with people my own age and
enjoy my life.
Yay, so we’re good.
You know, I don’t know if this counted as a
fight, but how about some make-up sex?
Ooh!
Ooh!
This is so exciting. If Leonard and Penny get back
together, Howard and I can go on double dates with
them.
Mm, uh… How’s it going in there, Penny?
Yes.
When did you and Leonard break up?
Why do you think he asked you out again?
Maybe.
Do you think you’ll sleep with him tonight?
You can make-believe, though. Sometimes Howard and I pretend that
his arrhythmia is acting up and I’m a sexy cardiologist.
And the naughty part is I’m not in his HMO
network.
Relax. You know Leonard’s always been crazy about you. It’s
gonna be great.
Sure, we’d love that. Change your clothes, we got a
lot riding on this.
I’m so disappointed it didn’t work with him and Penny.
Boy, I don’t know if I could be friends with
Howie if we broke up.
I’m a very vengeful person.
With access to weaponised smallpox.
Howard.
Oh, that’s nice.
Ooh!
What about me and Howard?
Where are you guys going to eat?
Oh, smells amazing in here.
Who’s Siri? Is he dating somebody new?
Oh. Is that cute or creepy?
I don’t know if I want to stay.
He’s gonna learn to poop in space.
Howard doesn’t make me do his shopping, or take him
to the dentist, or pick up his dry cleaning, right?
Turn it over. I’m hoping my relatives think it’s Hebrew.
You mean my special day?
If I ever actually ever get married.
My dad. Because I make a lot more money than
Howie, he’s putting a lot of pressure on me to
get a pre-nup.
Yeah. Howie’s gonna freak out.
I just don’t know how I’m gonna break it to
him.
I don’t know, I don’t want to manipulate him with
sex.
Are you mad at me?
So, what are we gonna do?
I don’t know. My dad’s pretty insistent on it, though.
Really? Oh, that’d be so great.
I should probably give you a heads-up about a couple
of things. Even though he’s retired from the police force,
he still carries his gun. But don’t worry, he won’t
shoot it. It’s more of a fashion statement.
And just to be safe, when you talk to him,
don’t bring up Jimmy Carter, gardeners, foreign people, homosexuals, Sean
Penn, Vatican II, gun control, organic food, the designated hitter
rule, recycling or the fact that you’re Jewish.
So the thing to watch for, if he’s shouting at
you, you’re okay, but if he starts to get real
quiet, leave as quickly as you can without making eye
contact. Not in a straight line, throw some zigs and
zigs in there.
In May you’re gonna be on the International Space Station.
That is big.
And ugly.
I don’t know. You can’t take it down. You’ll break
her heart. Look at that face. That enormous, unsettling, crazy
face.
That depends. Do you like pictures of yourself where you
look like a man?
What will you tell Amy?
Nuh-uh. What if she gets me one? I already have
a picture of me and Howard’s mom getting our hair
cornrowed in Venice Beach. I’ve suffered enough.
Mmm, too bad you’re not as strong as the dude
in the painting.
I’ve got to go. I’ve got to get up early.
My company’s testing a new steroid that supposedly doesn’t shrink
testicles, and the last one there has to do the
measuring.
Good night, real Penny.
Good night, transvestite Penny.
Hi, sweetie.
I miss you, too. So tell me all about your
first day.
Cool. How do they do that?
You threw up?
That sounds mean.
Sure, why?
Howie, what happened to you?
Survival training? Is that like camping?
Do you sleep in tents?
Poor baby.
You’re so brave. I’m proud of you.
Are you crying?
Howie, if you’re not able to do this, come home.
It won’t change how I feel about you.
Well, is there anything I could do to help?
Surprise.
I’m here to help you get through this. You can’t
do it on your own, you need someone to take
care of you.
Oh, I love you.
Get that guy! Get that guy! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!
Pew!
Ooh, look at this pretty purple robe I just got.
You should put on yours and then we’ll match.
Sorry, I just thought it’d be nice if people knew
we were a couple.
I can’t help it. My Howie Wowie has an owie.
I’m gonna go, too.
I’ll miss you.
No, I’ll…
Are you sure you want us here when you meet
this woman?
The nuns always chaparoned the dances at my high school.
They used to make us leave room between us for
the holy spirit.
So, arranged marriages. The parents just decide, and then you
have to get married?
Hello.
Raj, Howie told me what’s going on with you and
Lakshmi.
We believe there’s someone out there who’ll love you for
you.
Not necessarily. I think we’ve found someone for you to
cuddle with.
Metrosexual my ass.
Every time I spend the night, your mom slaps me
on the behind and says, go get ‘im.
Oh, my God, that’s terrible.
Why are you doing that? You’re being mean to him.
If you don’t want to get teased about that, get
a doctorate. I have one, they’re great.
It’s not the same thing. Sheldon doesn’t know when he’s
being mean because the part of his brain that should
know is getting a wedgie from the rest of his
brain.
No, you have to stop now.
Oh, damn. I’m sorry, I can’t make it, but Sheldon’s
going to go with you! And that’s the last thing
you do to him.
Um, these are gift bags we’re going to put in
the hotel rooms of our out-of-town guests. This is a
map of Pasadena. This is a list of local restaurants.
And then, for Howie’s relatives, we have antihistamines, antacids, and
medicine for diarrhoea and constipation.
Amy, please.
I’ve actually been thinking I’m going to hyphenate
Howard already took care of it. Plus, he set up
our beautiful wedding website with cute little facts about our
family histories. Do you know, for a while in Poland,
my family and his family were neighbours.
Funny. You boys have a nice time?
That’s nice.
You ain’t goin’ anywhere, Threeway.
You lied to me. You said you told me about
all the girls you’ve been with, but you never mentioned
your cousin, the prostitute or Raj!
Don’t you try and blame this on him.
Zip it, pervert!
I don’t know what I’m going to do. I’m supposed
to marry Howard in a couple of weeks and I’m
not sure I even know who the man is any
more.
When I first met Howard, he seemed so innocent to
me, just a sweet little guy who lives with his
mother.
Wait a minute. You set me up with Howard. Did
you know about all the creepy stuff he was into?
Why didn’t you tell me
My God! I thought you were my friend.
No, leave me alone.
Howie?
I heard. Your voice, not unlike your mother’s, travels through
walls.
No. Come here. I’m still really mad at you.
Is there anything else about your past I should know?
Okay.
Yeah, the wedding’s still on.
You’re kidding.
Oh, you’re in a good mood.
What’s so great?
Oh, Howie, that’s wonderful!
What happened? I thought they cancelled your mission.
When?
What? We’re getting married that Sunday.
Wait. I don’t want to be the one who stands
in your way.
No. That’s not how I want to start our marriage,
killing your dream. We’ll have the wedding when you get
back.
We’ll call them. Although my dad’s gonna go a little
nutso over losing his deposits.
I’ll talk to him. He won’t say no to his
little girl.
But, Howie, my dad can be a bully. He’s gonna
make you cancel your space flight.
Oh, God, I’m so nervous. I don’t think I can
watch.
Give me those damn Pringles.
Come on, Howard. I’m not falling for that again.
Oh, Howie. A little star, it’s beautiful. Put it on
me.
Oh, my God.
This is the most amazing gift I’ve ever gotten.
Howard, I don’t want to wait until you’re back to
get married.
I want to be married to you before you get
in that rocket.
We’ll have a quick little ceremony with just our friends,
and we’ll still have the big reception with everyone when
you get back.
So anyway, we decided to go down to City Hall
this afternoon get married, and then have the reception when
Howard gets back.
That wasn’t going to be our processional music.
So, what do you say, Amy?
Seriously? You’re going to wear that thing to City Hall?
Why wasn’t it a real proposal?
Howard, don’t talk like that on your wedding day.
Oh, no.
I can’t believe we’re not going to get married.
No, isn’t that kind of tacky?
Are any of them still married?
There’s got to be some place special we could do
it.
Oh, I like that.
Great, well, who’s it going to be?
No.
Why can’t she drive herself?
All right, just hurry!
Not now, Dad.
Here you go? What am I, a football?
They all got ordained, they’re all marrying us, it’s adorable,
if you want to hear come closer.
Sheldon! I told you no Klingon.
Howard Joel Wolowitz, like you, this is going to be
short and sweet. I love you with all my heart
and soul and promise to be with you forever.
Oh, my God, it’s happening.
I love that man.
