Hey, put him on speaker.
Hey, where are you?
Excuse me?
Oh, that's so sweet.
You asked Stephen Hawking and not her father?
Okay. Oh, my God, I can't believe you guys are
engaged.
Yay!
Do you think Sheldon's gonna want some weird Star Trek
wedding?
Well, Leonard could barely finish the words "Doctor Who wedding
cake" before I shut that down hard.
Are you listening to me?
Is everything okay?
Oh, my God, what is it?
Wha... Interesting.
Wait, you haven't told him yet?
You told me first? Oh, Bernie!
Yeah, I didn't even think you could get pregnant while
you were breastfeeding.
Okay, look, look, this is a good thing. Halley's gonna
have a little brother or sister to play with.
And, you know, I was a surprise to my parents,
and my dad said it was the best thing that
ever happened to them.
Oh, my God, honey, of course it is.
Yeah, what were you thinking?
You know, whenever I find a top I like, I
always go back and get a second one in a
different color. Which I hope is not the case with
your baby.
Yeah, anything at all, just ask.
I'm sorry, what?
Okay, we're not gonna have a baby just to make
you guys feel better.
Exactly.
Oh, crap, is it our anniversary?
No. All right, so what are we celebrating?
Ah. Left out? Well, Bernadette has to grow a baby
inside of her, and Amy has to marry one. My
life is great.
Try and take it away, see what happens.
Happy anniversary!
Yeah, I'm still mad at you.
Hey...
Just... hey.
Here, drink this. It might help.
Well, that's why I brought the bottle.
Oh, I would totally do high school all over again.
But that doesn't help you.
Ooh, look at my bad boy getting called to the
principal.
Ooh, look at my bad boy answering questions nobody asked.
Hey, come on, look, you said a few dumb things
on the radio-- what is the worst that could happen?
Okay, well, even if you did, you could find another
job.
Great, I'll leave you to it.
Hey. I thought you were coming right back.
In mouthwash? Man, that is so summer camp.
Aw, now I'm depressed.
Okay. So you guys are upset because the collider thing
disproved your theories?
Come on. You guys are physicists. Okay? You're always gonna
be physicists. And sure, sometimes, the physics is hard, but
isn't that what makes it boring?
Okay. As far as I can see, science is dead,
because Leonard killed it. And, uh, I don't know who
the Romulans are, but those guys know how to party.
I don't know. You're scientists; cheer them up.
Thanks for coming.
Okay. That is enough. Your lives are not wasted. Your
careers are not at a dead end. You just hit
a rough patch. Instead of feeling sorry for yourselves, you
need to get up and get inspired.
I don't know. You know, when I'm feeling down, I
go for a run, which is exactly why I'm not
180 pounds, genius!
I know who he is. Leonard dressed as him for
Halloween last year.
I had no idea Richard Feynman was dead.
Oh, wow. He's buried with his wife.
Okay.
Ah, we got to see him run.
Oh, exciting. You guys picked a date?
Mm. There's no perfect dessert.
No!
So very long.
Yeah. You got a good one.
Well, maybe this is a part of Sheldon's personality he's
been repressing. I mean, I think we dream about things
we wish we could be in real life.
Oh. Uh... being the wife of Leonard. Mostly that.
Then again, mine are just about being married to this
little guy.
Yeah. Will you e-mail that to me?
Honey, that's you.
Hey, this isn't your laundry night.
Why is this sleep-talking thing bothering you anyway?
Is it possible that you're stressed because you're scared about
getting married? I mean, it is a big change, and
you're not good with little changes.
Uh, when they changed the green Skittle from lime to
apple.
All right, fine. Let's start over. Is it possible that
the sleep-talking is a part of your brain that's telling
you everything's gonna be okay and you just need to
relax a little?
In laymen's terms, yeah.
Maybe in my twenties, not anymore.
Well, I would start with something small, see if it
makes your life any better. Um, you can learn to
meditate, take a yoga class.
Okay, sure.
Sure. You know, I've never had a mole check.
Mm-hmm. Anything with a neck wider than a nickel.
Hey, where are you going?
Well, if you didn't make me wear the green body
paint in bed, you wouldn't have to get it dry-cleaned
so much.
Hey, wait, it's your mom.
Hey, Beverly.
Uh, Leonard just left. He's gonna be so upset he
missed your call.
Because he... Yeah, I don't know. How are you?
Um, personally? Like, what'd you do last night?
Sure. Sure. because you were full.
Oh, uh, hey, Beverly, you called my phone, not Leonard's.
Uh, that depends. What time is it where you are?
Yeah, that counts. What's up?
What?
Uh, well, you know, I'm here for you. What do
you want to talk about?
Well, you know, if we're gonna be real girlfriends, we
should get a third girl we can trash behind her
back.
Ooh, "dour." Meow.
Leonard, did you really just text me from the couch
to put extra mustard on your sandwich?
I swear to God, I will throw this out.
Oh, wait, it was just your mom.
Yeah. We've been talking a lot lately.
No, I think she's lonely. She's been reaching out.
Yeah. I've been telling her about my job, and she
said she was proud of me.
Do you not want me to be friends with your
mom?
Oh, that's okay.
Yeah, which is why it's okay.
Neat. I've been rewatching The O.C., so we're all leading
productive lives.
It never occurred to me I would miss the Ewok
conversation.
Aw, you got him a mug?
A parenting book.
Wha... No! You think this is how I would tell
you?
Bernadette left it here.
Well, I just saw a picture of a baby's head
crowning, so I hope you enjoyed s?x, because we're done
with that.
Hi.
Aw, his smile of disappointment has turned into a frown
of joy.
Sheldon, honey, if you want to join us for dinner,
you're more than welcome.
Okay, what is going on?
Didn't that just start this morning?
You know, that would frustrate me. Does it frustrate you?
You know, it's okay to feel frustrated when things aren't
going your way.
No, no, no, your feelings are valid. Now, why don't
you go wash up, and we'll call you when dinner's
ready.
No, I've been reading Bernadette's parenting book. It's like the
answer key to the Sheldon test.
I know. But, you know, it's only birth to five.
What do we do when he turns six?
Well, what are you gonna say?
No, no, no. He'll just think that means "Be there
in a minute." Uh... Maybe there's something in the book
that will help.
Okay. Let's see, let's see. "Biting other children"?
Okay, wait, wait. Here we go. "Let him have ownership
of his choices. Allow him to choose from options that
are acceptable to you."
Wow, it worked.
Yeah, that is a good point. I'm really proud of
the way you're able to express your feelings.
You know, everyone gets angry. Even mommies and daddies.
Okay, what about "presenting a united front"?
Look. You sound frustrated, and I'm really proud of the
way you're able to state your opinion.
What? So has he.
So is this how it's gonna be if we have
kids? You're just gonna throw me under the bus? LEONARD
Uh, my way was working. Okay? I think you're just
upset because there are some things I am better than
you at.
If you're so smart, was that a smart thing to
say?
No.
And you're sad you won't be able to bear his
child?
Aw. Thought you did it just to get girls.
If he's talking, he's talking about himself.
I... I don't know what to say. Leonard, do you
know what to say?
Hey!
Well, it's not lying-- it's acting. Sheldon Cooper may not
like kids, but Professor Proton loves them.
Why don't we have a dog?
Oh. Sheldon, obviously, I'd be happy to help you out.
What?
Hi, guys. Wanted to check in and see how you
two were doing.
I thought Raj was helping you out.
Well, you're... I can get the baby.
Don't be silly. I'll take the rest of the day
off and watch Halley for you.
Okay, hang on. Do you guys not trust me to
take care of your baby?
Wow.
Hey, hey, hey, I can watch your stupid baby, okay?
If she cries, I will pick her up. If she's
hungry, I'll give her a bottle. And if she poops,
I'll light some incense.
Trust me, you guys have nothing to worry about. You
know, back in Nebraska, I raised all our baby pigs
right until the day they were slaughtered. So, unless your
baby's made of breakfast meat, she's fine.
Hey. All good. Dipped her pacifier in a little bourbon,
she conked right out.
Of course I'm joking. I don't share my bourbon.
What are you doing here?
Howard and Bernadette asked you to check up on me.
How irresponsible do you all think I am?
That is just a nice word for "irresponsible."
What?
You sure you don't want your spy to do it?
You really don't trust me? You had to have Amy
stop by?
Excuse me while I go take care of your baby.
Then I'll bring you your snack, and you can insult
me some more.
Hey, Halley. Aw, it's okay. Auntie Penny's here. Shh. Let's
get you changed. Your mommy and daddy say they trust
me, but they're full of the same stuff your diaper
is.
Aw, but I'm here for you, and I would never
let anything happen to you, because your Auntie Penny loves
you so much.
Uh, no. No, baby. I'm not your mama. Your mama's
the nice lady we're gonna go see right now so
I can rub this in her face. Do you hear
that, suckers? She called me Mama!
Hey.
Um, I need to talk to Penny alone.
What can I do for you?
Well, you just told me, so strong start.
Well, why not? They're both sciences. And I know because
they're classes my high school counselor said "weren't for me."
All right, well, then don't work with Bert.
Then work with him.
Then don't work with him.
Then work with him.
How many times are you gonna do this?
Okay, this is about science. Why'd you come to me?
Checkered past?
Really? Well, I've got a figure of speech about how
sexually promiscuous you can go be with yourself.
Oh...
All right, just give her some space, all right? Don't
call, don't text, don't e-mail.
All right, when do you see her next?
Uh, we're having dinner tonight.
Okay, put a rubber band around your wrist, and any
time you start planning your wedding or naming your children,
I want you to stab yourself in the hand with
a fork.
To slow the bleeding.
Hold on. Where is he?
Oh, I know this one. Nobody ever.
Done. So, Tesla's the one that invented the electric car?
Okay, you don't have to be so smug about it.
You know, you went to see that movie It because
you thought it was about scary I.T. guys.
Didn't he invent the lightbulb?
You know, that documentary last night was actually better than
I thought it would be.
I already pretended to laugh at that joke once. Do
I have to do it again?
Samuel Morse. You kill me.
Leonard, what are you doing? He said he can't go.
Make a sad face, move on.
Leonard! Sad face, sad face.
I thought they fired you guys.
Wow, she just told you that out of the blue?
Get to the point!
So what did you do?
You have to say something to Bernie.
Raj, you can't go on sleeping with a woman who's
trying to screw over your friend.
You know, maybe you're all more like the guy who
didn't invent the electric car and less like the guy
who didn't invent the lightbulb.
So, how's the wedding planning going?
I thought you were looking at a cliff on the
beach.
Well, weddings aren't about the location. They're about standing up
in front of your family and friends and promising that
Sheldon will never move back in here.
Hey. What are you guys doing?
What-- You're kidding.
Okay, let the record show, I did not marry you
for money, but you just got way more attractive.
Hey there, pretty lady.
Come on, this one is so annoying.
You guys ready to order?
Oh, sure. Smile! Perfect.
What was that?
Bernadette. Hey, sweetie.
Everybody good?
Or you could just speak.
No, I missed an audition because my computer broke, and
I didn't get the e-mail. Would've been a perfect part
for me.
Shut up and eat your burger.
Didn't you order a burger?
Oh, that's sweet, but I'm not gonna take your computer.
Are you sure?
Oh, my God, that's right. You gave me your laptop.
That was so sweet.
Of course.
I gave it to my ex-boyfriend Zack.
Okay, Zack, thank you so much. We'll be right over.
He still has it.
Please don't make a big deal about this. It was
a long time ago, we were broken up.
You have names for our breakups?
Really? Wow, I thought it was so obvious, but okay.
Look, I know it's hard, but I think the best
thing to do after a breakup is to take some
time and be by yourself.
Do as I say, not as I do. I cannot
believe you're mad.
Oh, really? Tell that to your eyebrows. Bet I could
place a quarter between them, and it would just stay
there.
That is not true. Of course I was upset.
I'm sorry, are you mad that I dated Zack or
that you didn't?
Hi.
Come over to get laptops back from you?
All right, I'm sorry I gave away your stupid laptop.
Yeah.
Leonard thinks when we broke up, it didn't bother me.
What video?
Hello, Leonard. I was gonna write you an e-mail, but
I'm a little drunk, and spelling is a sober person's
game, so... I feel I owe you a 'splanation. I--
I'm sorry. A 'splanation.
Sheldon, go away. I'm making a video.
No, no, no. I am alone. I'm just telling Leonard
why I broke up with him.
I went out with him because he's great. And if
I kept going out with him, I probably would've married
him, and that's a little scary because I just don't
think I'm ready for that. You know, plus I have
got to learn how to spell Hofstadter. I-I know there's
a "D" in there, but it keeps moving every time
I try and write it. Sheldon, what do I do?
I am not gonna pass out. But thank you anyway.
I married you, jackass. I...
No.
No, he doesn't know how to steal Bitcoin. I mean,
he waves at trucks.
This was a good idea. It's been a long time
since we've had girls' night.
Hey, you had unprotected s?x with Howard. You deserve to
be miserable.
Hey, what's going on? You got a date?
Oh, what's science wearing?
Oh, I love the observatory. They tell you your weight
on all the different planets. Yeah. It's always bikini season
on Venus.
Of course. Let's see what you got.
I'm sure these two options will be f... So you-you
have other clothes at home?
Well, don't say that.
I'm so sorry the interview didn't go well.
Stop apologizing!
Have you ever thought about talking to some kind of
therapist about all this?
Well, what do you mean, that makes sense?
Well, that's not all Howard's fault. I mean, if Raj
doesn't want to be made fun of, then I... Hmm.
I don't know a nice way to finish this sentence.
I'm just saying, that's what friends do. You know, they
bust on each other. It doesn't mean anything.
Why is that?
Well, that's because you're... Wow. I don't know how to
finish that sentence, either.
Attaboy, champ.
Hey. You look good today.
Nothing. I felt bad about being mean to you, so
I'm being nice.
You look handsome.
Hey.
Wait, so you were making your hair look like that
on purpose?
Then you never saw any other people?
Wow.
Oh, so happy ending for you! Oh, and for him.
Uh, sorry. I thought you were wrapping things up.
Wow. I never knew science could be so interesting.
Oh, you sure do, sweetie.
Okay. Raj, you were terrific!
Oh, your hug just got downgraded to a high five.
Your palms are sweaty, too.
Decaf, genius.
Hey.
Oh, it's your brother's Christmas letter.
Aw, the people's pajamas have little horses on them, and
the horses' have little people.
Oh, come on, it's nice. You know that nonprofit he
works with? They built a hospital in Rwanda.
That is a good point. I hadn't thought of it
that way.
Hey.
Aw, that's what I got her.
Is that good?
Do you think that will also be historically accurate?
Hey. What are you doing?
Oh, fun. Can I help?
Uh, well, both of our jobs are going great.
Uh, yeah, but we did kind of forget about it,
so maybe just write "still married."
You know, maybe this is enough.
What is that a picture of?
How'd you get a picture of your own back?
Hey, that's a cute picture. Isn't that the day we
almost went to the beach?
No, that was the day we almost went to the
mountains.
Yeah.
Morning.
"Kept Fern alive"? Who's Fern?
We're really calling that brown thing alive? Okay. So, how
long have you been working on this?
Well, did you do it?
Okay, this is silly. Our lives are great.
So then why is this bugging you so much?
What do you mean?
Look, I want to do all those things someday, but
there's a bunch of stuff I want to do first.
I don't know, stay thin and have money.
Okay. Well, we've never been on a big trip together.
Okay, there's something for your letter
Great, let's do it.
It's like I can hear the ocean already.
Ooh, I want to see the birthday girl.
Hey, Halley can't reach the liquor cabinet. Why did you
baby-proof it?
Fair point.
Now, either way, you'll get flowers the next morning.
So Leonard, tell everyone your news.
He means he's writing a book.
Yeah. It's about a brilliant physicist who solves crimes using
science.
What?
Hey. Here's the sewing kit you asked for.
You were timing me?
What did you need the kit for?
Oh, someone's gonna be sore tomorrow.
Aunt Doe, right?
Did she ever figure out what that thing on her
knee was?
Hmm. Makes sense, she does like to bake.
Hey, what you doing?
Oh, yeah, is this the one where Mr. Green can't
sit next to anyone eating meat, and Uncle Light Blue
won't sit next to any of the darker colors?
Amy did. I solved it already.
Yeah. Same way I solved my jury duty summons, I
threw it away.
Yeah, and Amy gave me this plastic ring and told
me to hold on to it.
Hey, are you testing us to see who gets to
be in your wedding?
Yeah.
Uh, well, I spilled the cheese packet, so we're having
mac and nothing.
Why are you in such a good mood?
Uh, great. After all you've done for him, he should've
asked you.
And Amy's your best friend. I'm sure she'll come to
her senses and pick you.
No, I mean, it-it's just annoying. You know, we talk
every day. We see each other all the time. She's
always there for me, and basically-- oh, my God, Amy's
my best friend.
No, my best friend didn't ask me to be her
maid of honor. I'm pissed!
Hey, so is Bernadette okay with me being maid of
honor?
Uh, yeah.
Damn it. Hey, Stuart, you still want in on this
wedding?
Fine, I'll do it. But do me a favor and
unlock the liquor cabinet first.
No. If he had that, he'd be trying to prevent
NSYNC from breaking up.
Making a boat. When I was a kid, my dad
showed me how.
I did it! See? It's a... it's a boat. It's
also a hat.
Well, is everything okay? Yeah. He just wants some alone
time to work.
Fine. Make yourself at home.
Hey.
Oh, Amy, you're here... again.
So what's all this?
Uh, well, I remember telling Jenny Runyon that I would
teach her how to flirt with boys if she put
my name on her project. I got an "A," she
got pregnant.
Wow, that's amazing.
I threw Jenny's baby shower.
Wow, I didn't think anything could top last night's spelling
bee, but here comes math.
No, no, you guys do your experiments. I'll go pick
up dinner.
Sheldon? Sheldon? Sheldon?
I brought pizza.
What's that? Oh, yeah, that is an experiment to see
how many parallelograms I could draw while holding my breath.
And this?
"Fire-quake"?
Hey, I thought you were working on actual science.
Fine.
Mmm.
Mm. Agreed. You know what's blowing my mind? Somebody thought
about putting cheese in this crust.
You do understand that crust doesn't normally come with cheese
in it? Okay, all right, look. What got you excited
about dark matter in the first place?
So it's your rebound science?
Well, not the science you spend the rest of your
life with, but the one you use to make yourself
feel pretty again.
Well, if he couldn't figure it out, maybe it's just
wrong.
Interesting. So that would mean... that... Can't do this by
myself, buddy.
So it's sort of like a guitar string, but instead
of making an actual sound, each vibration is a different
particle.
It does not.
Well, decades? Really? It's-it's a string. How hard can it
be? It's straight, it's in a loop, it gets knotted
up with other strings.
See? How long did that take me, like a minute?
Sorry. I had to stop at Sheldon's and help him
solve string theory.
Yeah, turns out the answer's knots.
Mm, you can if you consider them sheets. Good night.
Oh, I know this one. We're actually pushing it really
hard. It treats mild dermatitis.
Adults and children who have absolutely, for sure, stopped growing.
Oh, shoot, shoot.
Ah-- GRAVY, yes. G-R-A-V-Y. Okay, gastric distress, redness, anal leakage,
vasculitis and yellow eyes.
Oh, right. That's why we went with "gravy."
Hey.
He knows he doesn't live here anymore, right?
Flaxitrite.
Why?
No.
No.
No.
No.
So, who was that?
What the hell? What are you doing here?
Okay, look, you have an office at work. Why don't
you go there?
What is this? A rental agreement. I will only use
the room for work. I-I won't sleep here, I won't
eat your food, I won't even use your bathroom.
Well, he does that now. At least this way we'll
get paid.
Why? He hasn't made a peep all day.
And now he's not.
I don't think they have Arby's in Japan.
Hey, I was wrong. There's an Arby's in Okinawa.
Hey, how'd it go?
Why are you smiling?
Hey.
What's that noise?
You poured yourself a Scotch.
Oh.
Ah. So, how's the book coming along?
Oh, is he based on you?
Yeah, that's smart, because CERN is in Switzerland and there's
a lot of cheese there.
Well, I'm excited to read it whenever you're ready.
Swiss army knife?
Figure that out yourself, genius?
Who would want to kill him?
Wow, you are on fire.
I like it. I can't wait to see who the
killer is. Is it that Ilsa girl? She seems pretty
mean.
No, regular mean, like a regular lion. But it seems
pretty accurate, considering who you based it on.
It's pretty obvious
Oh, really?
Well, sometimes you have to read in your car while
your husband thinks you're working late.
Oh, and-and what did you think?
Really? The Ilsa character didn't bother you?
Well, I know I'm not like that. The character was
based on you.
Well, when I brought it up, he... got all squirrelly
and left the room. Son of a bitch.
Looks like the bullet went right through you. Damn it,
Logan. When are you gonna stop?
You're a physicist. What makes you think you can solve
a crime?
No. There's no time. Does it hurt?
Then why do you keep coming back for more?
So this is what you think of me? Huh? I'm
mean and everything I do hurts you?
I know I'm Ilsa.
How? Well, you... She... Her name's Ilsa.
You know what? It's fine. Write whatever you want. And
by the way, Logan Dean can tell everyone he's five-eight,
but he's not fooling anybody!
What?
What are you doing? I thought you were supposed to
be on bed rest.
Here, let me help you.
I know you're joking, but I grew up on a
farm. I'll do it.
You know, when my yoga instructor was pregnant, she told
me there are tons of poses that put her right
into labor.
Okay, we're gonna start with some nice breathing exercises.
Oh, thank you.
Okay, we go down... and back up. And back up!
Smile.
And I brought Indian.
You know, I always thought Christian was a nice name.
Okay. I surrender.
Are you making these up or having a stroke?
It's not a champagne cork. Although that would be festive.
Yeah, you guys go. We'll take care of her. You
have nothing to worry about.
I-I'm just saying, we might get there first. You only
h?v? s?x once a year. I'll probably h?v? s?x tonight.
Fine, you can have Elliott.
When did you pick out our kids' names?
Yes.
Uh-uh!
Oh, my God. What, what, what? Is it the baby?
I'm sure they're fine.
Congratulations!
Oh, my God, I can't believe how big Halley's getting.
So how are you guys?
Okay, well, we all miss you.
Yeah, I don't think men have...
What is this picture?
It's too something.
Oh, hey.
What do you mean? Leonard's a member.
Hey, wait, you told me it was exclusive, too.
Damn, Hofstadter, didn't think you had it in you.
Hey. There you are.
Just a few more weeks, you'll be back full-time, huh?
Uh-oh. That wasn't a happy "yeah." That was a "Hey,
Leonard, do you want to go to the gym?" yeah.
Wow. That's big.
No, I think we're just gonna...
Nothing-nothing for me.
Love your kids. Don't miss your job.
I wouldn't mind a cookie. And he's gone. Okay.
Well, I've know them for 11 years, so... 11 years.
All right, I'm putting a stop to this.
Hey, guys, guess what? Today at work, I found out
I am going to meet Bill Gates.
I'm not leaving him for Bill Gates.
Well, his foundation is looking to partner with a pharmaceutical
company to help develop affordable vaccines so they asked me
to show him around.
Uh, he gets in on Sunday, and Monday morning, I'm
gonna give him a tour of the labs and offices.
What're you talking about?
Literally never pulled a prank on you.
That was a mistake.
Sheldon, I swear...
Oh, you're right. He's not coming. April fools.
Well, I'm a little nervous. You know, if I do
a good job, I'm hoping they'll consider me for a
PR position that's opening up.
I think I'll be okay.
What are high-level language interpreters for microcomputers?
Oh. That's actually kind of interesting. Tell me more.
That, I'll do that. Mm-hmm.
Yeah, well... You never do.
Look, I know you want to meet him, but I
can't turn this into a social thing, okay? This is
my job. I really need it to go well.
Oh, really? Was he nice?
Well, you were a kid.
Oh, hey.
Uh, that's not mine.
No.
Yes.
What would the prank part even be?
Have you been eating laundry detergent?
Sheldon, he is really coming.
He is.
Yeah.
Hey, I think I'm gonna head to the office for
a little bit.
Yeah. Want to make sure I'm prepared for tomorrow.
Yeah, maybe, like what?
His call will be to the police.
Guys, even if I wanted to introduce you, there is
no room in his schedule. I mean, look. Look at
this itinerary. I meet him at his hotel first thing
tomorrow morning, then we're on the go all day long.
Thank you, honey.
Love you. I totally just saw what hotel he's staying
at.
Hey, where you been?
They still mad at me?
You're a good husband.
Well, as it turns out, there is a little reception
for Mr. Gates tomorrow night. I asked if I could
bring you, and they said yes.
Yeah, you get to meet Bill Gates again.
because you met him that one time with your mom.
Yeah. I wonder if he'll remember you.
Aw, are you sure you can't come?
Aw. And you really wanted to meet him.
Yeah. Yeah, you do look pretty pale and clammy.
Well, feel better, okay?
Aw, hey, sweetie, how you feeling?
Well, I have a surprise that might make you feel
better.
Wait, what? What's he talking about?
Hi.
Oh, I grabbed a sandwich at the food truck out
front.
That my fun, young life took a drastic turn somewhere?
Yeah, and you have Chinese food. So eat it.
Oh. The truck's called "Pearl of Sandwich." Now I get
it.
The pastrami truck moved.
No, apparently someone complained to the tenants association, and they're
not allowed to park on our street anymore.
And they actually took you seriously?
Oh, great, because I'm about to send them an e-mail
complaining about you.
What is going on here?
Okay, so when I got a fine for leaving my
clothes in the dryer for too long, that was from
you?
Do you know he is the entire tenants association?
Yeah.
Then we call an emergency meeting.
Okay, can we vote you out now?
Yeah, we're waiting, best friend.
Ugh, I can't believe my best friend sided with Sheldon.
Ugh. I would've gone the other way, but it would've
gotten to his throat.
What?
So you just let him get away with anything?
It's not about the sandwich. It's about the principle.
Yeah.
Hey, you know, that's actually a good plan.
Hi.
Oh, yeah. Sorry. You know, it's been a crazy couple
months.
Anyway, meeting's tomorrow. We really hope you can make it.
Uh, Sheldon Cooper. You know, about yay tall and about
yay annoying.
Really? Why?
So, Mrs. Petrescu, we were hoping you would vote for
Leonard instead of voting for Sheldon.
No, no. Vote Leonard.
Yeah, and when I moved across the hall, you got
taken off the lease and I got added.
I second it.
Wait, you're the reason I had to come back and
get my jeans the next morning?
Thank you.
Me, too.
Hey!
Are you gonna be doing that all weekend?
Because you're getting married!
Yeah, as someone who has to track him every time
he gets lost in IKEA, I feel like I'd be
really good at that.
Oh, just about who you're marrying.
Welcome to your... bachelorette party!
Yeah, instead of oiled-up strippers and s?x toys, we thought
Are you having fun?
Oh, lovely. Oh.
Huh?
Well, you said you didn't want anything crazy.
Of course not.
Well, don't you?
Yeah. She had two kids back-to-back and I thought you'd
like this, so we're off to a good start.
Yes.
All right, you know what, why don't we stay home,
have a little wine...
It's when you take a drink out of a stranger's
belly button.
Okay, look, we've got all night. Let's just take it
easy. We can...
Oh, she said she didn't want one.
Why? She's sound asleep, and we have sliders coming.
Oh, look who's back!
Well, you didn't pass out before you did all kinds
of fun stuff.
Um... well, you don't remember Riverdancing on top of the
bar?
Mm-hmm.
Didn't stop you from teaching all those shirtless firemen.
Saw, smelled, slid down like a pole.
Yeah. But if there were pictures, they would be crazy.
Mm.
Hey, why'd you lug your telescope all the way over
here? Leonard has one in our apartment.
I don't know. It seemed pretty good. You know, once
when the cable went out, I watched an entire episode
of The Bachelor on a TV across the street.
So was the girl he picked!
I know Mercury is a planet. But the-the other thing
was helpful.
Yeah, sure.
Okay. Oh, what is that?
No, there's something fuzzy.
No. Yes. Shut up. Look. Look at that. I think
I see something.
It's not an eyelash!
Okay. Here.
Told you.
Who is that?
Who is he mad at?
Who's that?
Great.
Hey.
Really? Look at that! I discovered a comet!
Well, I'm the one who saw it. In my telescope
that I positioned. All you did was look into it.
Are you kidding me?
No, he didn't. He thought it was an eyelash!
Yeah, the thing I saw first.
But I took the picture.
Excuse me?!
Get the hell out of my apartment!
Okay, look, I Googled it. I took the picture, so
it's my discovery. He stole my comet.
Yes, I care. This happens to me all the time.
People take one look at me and assume I don't
know what I'm talking about.
Oh, I'm sure that's not true.
I'm sorry. Are you saying I don't know what I'm
talking about?
Look, I'm serious. The other day at work, I had
this great idea, but no one was listening to me.
And then five minutes later, Paul said the same thing,
and they practically carried him around the room.
Well, CPK for lunch, but that's just one example. It
also happens with all the doctors I have to deal
with. You know, they're so condescending. I'm so sick of
letting this stuff slide. I found that comet. Why should
I let Raj say he found it?
Okay, so you agree with me, but he still gets
his way?
My God, you're such a people-pleaser. You can't stand making
anyone angry.
because it would mean you were on my side.
I'm glad you think so, because I may be living
here soon.
Hey. Where have you been?
And? Is he gonna give me back my comet?
Did you cave?
Did you just think of that on your way home?
Well, you make a good point. I'm gonna go talk
to Raj myself.
That was enough.
I haven't even said anything yet.
They are angry. I'm mad at you.
Thank you.
Good. Bye.
Ooh, this one's pretty.
I can't wait to get drunk and pick a fight
with her at your wedding.
No. This is just to give you ideas. You know,
do-do you want something simple and elegant? I mean, do
you want a train?
The kind on the back of a wedding dress?
Mm. Well, I've got a push-up bra I can loan
you that always gets me free drinks.
Then I'd go no bra.
Mmm.
Can you?
Well, it's too much money, you can't ask for that
all at once.
Okay. What if you asked for $20 million?
Do you even know who Lady Gaga is?
Thanks.
What? Helping Amy find a dress or day drinking?
Amy, oh, my God.
Oh, don't be silly. You can't buy the first dress
you try on. That'd be like marrying the first guy
that you... You can't buy the first dress you try
on. Little finger sandwiches, too. This place is amazing.
Are you okay?
Boy, you know, when Sheldon sees you in that dress,
he's gonna want to methodically take it off, fold it
up, carefully place it in a storage box, label it,
and then ravish you.
Great. Keep going.
Do you? I do.
Wow.
Yes. Amy found a dress that she liked.
She-she did look happy. I mean, her face was just
glowing, so...
Mm. So we agree it's awful?
Should we say something?
But don't you think she brought us with her because
she wants our honest opinion?
I do.
I don't want her to look back and think she
made some awful mistake.
Someone's gonna say something. It should be us now instead
of everyone at her wedding.
And together.
I don't.
Hey, I can't believe you just threw me under the
bus.
Well... Do you know how that makes me look?
Well... Why didn't you tell her that you didn't like
the dress, either? I mean, what happened to our united
front?
Hi. Do you have a minute?
Look, I'm sorry. I never should have said I didn't
like your dress. It's your wedding, and all that matters
is that you feel beautiful.
So, are... are we good?
Well, why? I just said you should wear it.
No, I don't hate it.
There is a lot of room between "don't like" and
"hate." You know, it's-it's where you find rice pudding and
jazz. Anyway, who cares what I think?
Okay, that would be flattering, except I know all the
people in your life. Look, Amy, I don't know what
to say. I think I got stuck on the fact
that it's not a dress I would choose, but it
shouldn't be. You know, it's your dress. I mean, hey,
would you marry Leonard?
Okay, a simple "no" would have been fine, but... you
see my point.
Yes, and from now on, I am gonna remember that
this wedding is all about you.
Oh, she is the worst.
Mm. Now it's starting to sound like a wedding.
Hey! Hey. Hey. Step away from the bride.
Yeah, and all the rest of your clothes! Ah, worth
a shot.
Oh, my God.
Wow. You really can't keep your hands off Howard, can
you?
Well, I didn't get it.
It's not funny.
Ah, hey. Could you just, like, not touch my computer
or... like, anything else. I just, ugh, I don't want
to look like that in your wedding photos.
Oh, well... Turns out this is gonna come in handy
after all.
It looks like it's getting better.
I'm sorry. Are you mad that I don't have pink
eye?
Hey! I got all the beads to the other side.
You know, maybe we didn't all need to come.
Yeah!
Oh.
All right, Saturday is the big day. A lot of
people thought this would never come. I may have been
one of those people.
And yet, here we are. Now, we got a lot
of family coming in tomorrow. I'm gonna need everyone's help.
Think of this as one of your comic book movies.
There's a bunch of superheroes, each with a different task.
Uh, Mr. Fowler, are you okay back there? Do you
need more air?
Oh, well, you know, she's pretty busy the day before
her wedding.
Oh, my God.
Amy, you never said you were in a school play.
Uh, excuse me. Where-where are you going?
Sit down!
Sheldon loves Amy, and he would never hurt her on
her wedding day or any other day, so park it.
What are you lunatics doing?!
Oh, science? Shocking!
All right. It's go time! I am pumped! Okay, everyone.
Here we go.
