Oh, really. Blink twice if you’re here against your will.
Let me know if you need anything.
Hello again.
A 13-year-old girl. But if you’re dead set on a
comic book, try this.
A morally ambiguous confidence man who smokes, has lung cancer
and is tormented by the spirits of the undead.
Depends. Do you like it?
Yes, that’s you.
It’d still be you, but I’d feel like an idiot.
You drive a hard bargain, but here.
Hey, guys.
It is great. Really great. Freaking awesome. What are you
guys doing?
Yeah, see you guys.
Yeah, it would have been nicer if he hadn’t touched
all the cheese.
Oh, gee, it’s a little late for coffee, isn’t it?
Uh, yeah, I guess.
We’re having coffee.
It’s okay. She thinks she has decaf.
What’s up?
Oh yeah. Those guys can be very stubborn. What’s the
topic?
Ooh, Sheldon, I’m afraid you couldn’t be more wrong.
Of course it is. It’s a little wrong to say
a tomato is a vegetable, it’s very wrong to say
it’s a suspension bridge. But returning to the original issue,
Dick Grayson became Nightwing, a superhero in his own right.
Batman 2 has to be the second Robin, Jason Todd.
Oh, great!
I’m sorry, but you’re obviously stuck in a pre-Zero Hour
DC universe.
Okay, you can throw all the French around you want,
it doesn’t make you right.
Plus, you’re forgetting that the Infinite Crisis storyline restored Joe
Chill to the Batman mythology.
Okay, look, Sheldon, it’s late and I’ve got to get
some sleep.
No, I’m tired.
Fine. You win.
Penny, I really had a terrific time. Penny?
You know, I don’t think that was decaf.
Here, Sheldon, I pulled the new Hellboy for you. It’s
mind-blowing.
I didn’t spoil anything.
I’m sorry.
Uh, hey, Leonardrd, can I talk to you about something?
Remember I went out with your friend Penny a couple
weeks ago?
Well, uh, the thing is, the date didn’t go that
well.
I can’t do that.
‘Cause we’re going out again tomorrow.
No.
Uh, anyway, I figured this is probably my last shot
with Penny and I don’t want to screw it up.
So, here’s my question. It’s the second date, you think
she’ll be expecting things to get physical?
Okay, so, you’ll give me a call?
Great.
Hey Leonardrd.
You busy?
Well, tonight’s my date with Penny and since we haven’t
been able to connect by phone…
Or e-mail.
Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute
advice.
Okay.
Fear?
Well, that plays right into my wheelhouse.
Thanks, Leonardrd. What is that thing anyway?
No.
Sure, what’s up?
No, your advice was great.
Yeah, going slow really worked.
Yeah, last night at dinner, I did what you told
me, I went really slow, I kept my distance, and
two bottles of wine later, we were making out in
my car.
It doesn’t matter, that’s where it all went to hell.
No, everything was good and really hot, and I said
“Oh, Penny,” and right where she was supposed to say,
“Oh, Stuart,” she said… your name.
That is your name, right?
Well, it beats you know I’m a dude, right? Yeah,
it was pretty bad.
Not your fault.
Yeah, sure.
