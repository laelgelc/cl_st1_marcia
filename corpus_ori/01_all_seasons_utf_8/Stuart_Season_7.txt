 Happy to, unless it’s hope or a reason to live.
 Okay, well, I don’t know how much you want to spend, but I do have this pretty cool Aquaman statue.
 Yeah, just as well. It’s a pretty rare piece. I’d rather just sell it to a real collector.
 Oh, I shouldn’t even have mentioned it. How about a Batman squirt gun?
 All right, Sheldon, you win. I’m sure Leonard is gonna love this.
 Ooh, yeah, I don’t know. This squirt gun, it’s, uh, it’s pretty rare.
 Oh, my pleasure. Always happy to help out with fun things that I wasn’t invited to be a part of.
 Yeah. So when you guys plan fun activities, does my name even come up, or…?
 No, you didn’t.
 So no one’s gonna buy anything.
 Is make-up really necessary?
 You got it.
 I don’t think I can give you that.
 Sure. Hey, have you finished writing your profile yet?
 I put unobjectionable. But now that I hear it out loud, it just seems like I’m being cocky. What did you put for your best feature?
 I put
 Really? Like what?
 Neither of those things have ever helped me meet a woman.
 I do have one oddly long testicle.
 That’s it. Our dating profiles are live on the Internet.
 That’s right, ladies. For all you know, I’m confident and fun to be around.
 If it is, I’ll take her. Ooh, I got one, too. The ladies are coming to us. Oh, man, if I’d started this years ago, I’d be divorced two or three times by now.
 Well, they’re not running away screaming, so, no.
 Combined?
 Zero.
 I don’t think I’ve ever felt so rejected. And I had a rescue dog who ran back to the pound.
 And make them look us in the eye.
 Hello.
 Oh, good, I’m glad you guys didn’t wait for me to start. Although you said seven and it’s, it’s seven, but that’s fine.
 Hello.
 Me neither.
 Don’t need to see it. Living it.
 I was okay with it.
 Hey, guys.
 I just wanted to be in anyone’s story.
 ‘Cause Leonard was fat.
 I’ll stop now.
 Not until I get my kiss.
 When I was a baby, my mother called me her little possum.
 Not at all.
 How about her?
 Fine. How about that old lady with the walker?
 We’ll find somebody else.
 How about that lady in the sweat suit, speed-walking?
 We could go over to that department store, practice on the mannequins.
 How about those guys on that bench over there? They look pathetic. I bet we could talk to them.
 Oh, yeah.
 Smooth.
 Hey.
 Yes, but at this point, pretty much any customer does. What can I do for you?
 Wow. What happened?
 Well, don’t let The Riddler know that. It’s a comic book joke. Or maybe it’s not.
 Uh, well, it’s, it’s pretty rare. Can you give me a few days to track it down?
 Oh. What’s the hurry?
 Well, I’ll do what I can, but I can’t make any promises.
 Really? Do you have any of these?
 All right, thanks a lot. They have one at Capital Comics.
 No, it’s not. I hate that place. Guy who owns it is a jerk. He’s always making me feel bad about myself.
 You know, why don’t I just take you there? That way, I can make sure he doesn’t rip you off.
 Yeah. Haven’t seen this many people in my store since that Korean church bus crashed through my front window.
 Jesse.
 My hair’s exactly the same colour as always.
 Look, uh, my friend here needs a comic book.
 Even you, Sweatpants?
 It’s on Merton Avenue.
 You know something, Jesse? You may have a successful business and the kind of pink complexion that comes with good nutrition, but I have something more important.
 Friendship. Which I would trade in a heartbeat for all of this.
 Hey, guys.
 How’s it going?
 Oh, how is it?
 No, I don’t feel so…
 What do you think I was gonna do at home?
 Bernadette, can you not stand so close to me?
 Suit yourself. But I can kind of see up your skirt.
 Hey, can I go to the bathroom?
 That’s my jam.
 I think you and Leonard will be together.
 Yeah. I think you’re the best couple I know.
 Uh, well, I feel like you guys make each other better. Penny brought Leonard out of his shell. And it seems like Leonard makes Penny think more deeply about the world. I don’t know. Together, you two kind of make one awesome person.
 My phone doesn’t have a calendar. So I’ll just write it on my hand.
 I knew it.
 Hey, Sheldon.
 I was cooking in the back room last night and the hot plate caught on fire.
 I was across the street at the do-it-yourself car wash, taking a shower.
 Um, I don’t know. I’m waiting to hear back from the insurance company.
 I don’t mean to be rude, Sheldon, but, uh, my life is kind of falling apart right now.
 Well, sorry I let you down.
 That’ll be $2.99.
 Fine, a dollar.
 No, I only have hundreds.
That could have killed me. I can’t catch a break.
 No. God, you sound like the police, the firemen, my parents, my therapist and the insurance company.
 Uh, actually, I was wondering if I could crash at your place for a few nights.
 You slept with her? Nice.
 Great.
 So what’s the catch?
 Hey. What are you guys still doing here? I got this, go. Go home.
 Yeah, she’s fed, she took her pills, she’s all tucked in and watching TV.
 Are you kidding? I love her, she’s great.
 Coming, Debbie.
 She insisted. So, hey, guys, thank you so much. This job is a dream come true.
