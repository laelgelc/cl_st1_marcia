 Oh, my God. I cannot believe it. 
 I don't know. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 Yeah, you're mean to Leonard. I heard you.
 Look, I'm gonna tell you something, but you can't freak out, because I'm already freaking out.
 I'm pregnant again.
 Howard's gonna lose his mind.
 No.
 This wasn't supposed to happen-- we were careful.
 Well, guess what? You can.
 I guess that would be pretty cute.
 Okay. Maybe this baby actually is a blessing.
 How am I pregnant again?
 Uh, sure, but first, why don't you have a seat? There's something I need to show you.
 Yes. 
 Yes. 
 Yes. 
 Yes.
  Well, it did. 
  Yes! 
  Yes! Yes! Yes! 
 What do you mean what are we gonna do? We're gonna have another baby. 
 Stop that! 
 Yes! 
 Look, I know it's scary, but... we're both responsible adults, we can do this.
 No! 
 Good, you know? Obviously, it was a surprise. There was some crying and some yelling. 
But then we realized that it's a gift, in the sense that we didn't ask for it, and we may not have chosen it... 
 Ooh, you know what you could do? You could have a baby, too. 
 I say lots of crazy things. I'm pregnant and hormonal. Do it! Have a baby, do it! 
 Me, Sheldon. I'm obviously pregnant. 
 Well, Sheldon, I'm pregnant. 
 About three months. 
 Should he be saying that? 
 You ready for lunch? 
 Ooh, someone's got a lot of fancy new lab equipment.
 Fingers crossed. 
 Which is ironic, because if you had Fowler's palsy, you wouldn't be able to cross your fingers. 
 I'm surprised Sheldon's not up here playing with all your new toys. 
So you're just gonna hide your success from him? 
 No. I do that, too. How he thought my company retreat was in Boise? It was in Tahiti. 
 Take that part of yourself and hide it away. Just like I did with last year's bonus check that I "didn't get." 
 He said that to your face? What a dick. You know, you're a successful woman. You should be able to brag about your accomplishments once in a while. 
 Well, so should you. I mean, the guys are never shy about bragging. 
 Tell me about it. Howie texts me every time his dog levels up in Warcraft. 
 We should be able to do that, too. 
 That's a great idea. 
 You know, there's so much money in pharmaceuticals, we don't even wash out our test tubes. We just throw them out and get new ones. 
 Whoa. Those things are so expensive.
 At the office, I have two assistants. I don't even know their names, I just call them Thing One and Thing Two.
 Oh. I guess that's one of the benefits of being in the private sector. That and all the money I make.
 Hey, my work makes people's lives better. Especially if you have moderate to severe eczema and don't mind if you lose teeth. 
 It is a real thing. It happens to be a side effect of our cholesterol drug.
I hope it does. Because I'm gonna see that world from a yacht so big, you can land a helicopter on it. 
 No! 
 Too bad you didn't get your ducks in a row, because tonight would have been perfect. 
 Hey, just a reminder-- I'm going out for drinks after work. 
 I'm not drinking, just taking a new coworker out. 
 Female coworker. She's new in town, and I want to make her feel welcome. And let her know the office is full of liars before everyone tells her I'm mean. 
 I'm not setting her up with Raj. 
 Are you listening? I want her to think I'm not mean. 
 Howie, I just met this woman. Why don't I wait a little and get to know her? Maybe I won't like her, and then I'd be happy to ruin her life with Stuart or Raj. 
 Oh, they are. Super nice. I mean, only one them took you out tonight-- but it's not a competition. 
 Oh, it's okay. One of the great things about being pregnant is drinking cranberry juice out of a wineglass and watching people freak out. 
 Oh, damn. 
 Yeah, seren-frickin'-dipity. 
 Ruchi is my coworker. But that was probably in your briefing packet. 
 Oh, it's not like that. He rents a room from me and my husband. Who, by the way, is no prize, either. 
 because it wasn't. Which reminds me, before we leave, let's get you a vasectomy. HOWARD
 Absolutely. 
 Well, she's nine months old, so unless it jingles or is in my bra, she doesn't care. DOCTOR
 Yeah. Boy, girl, as long as it's healthy. 
 Oh. 
 I already have a little version of Howard.
 Howie, there's a lot of amazing things you can teach a son. 
 So, you don't want to hang out with Sheldon and Howard? 
 I'm just boxing up all the clothes Halley's outgrown. Guess we won't need them anymore. 
 "Daddy's little girl"? 
 Wow, you're really good at this. 
 Why? You got your sister's hand-me-downs? 
 Just because it's a boy, I don't think you need to put a picture of genitals on his shirt. 
 No, I'm fine. It's just, I grew up with a bunch of brothers, so I thought it'd be nice for Halley to have a sister. Is that wrong? 
 You're rough and tumble?
 Thanks for letting me put Halley in your room. 
 Oh, and, Penny, she kinda threw up on your stuffed bear. 
 Yeah, Howie's the world's best engineer. It says so right on his coffee mug. 
 Yeah, I lost that battle years ago. 
 Oh, hey, Raj. Howard's not here. 
 That's weird, I thought his work wife was standing in my kitchen. 
 Oh, thank you. There are a few things around the house that I've been waiting for Howard to get to. The smoke alarms... 
 Like you're not really here to help me. 
 Everything's fine. Howard's really excited about his work, he's been in a great mood... I'm really proud of him. 
 You're right. I have a teething baby, I'm pregnant, I have a proposal due tomorrow. I don't have time to hear about how much you're missing my husband. 
 No, it is not. 
 I'm really busy. I don't have time to listen to you complain. 
 What do you want? 
 Well, maybe you could do something he likes and make him jealous. 
 Have you ever read Tom Sawyer? 
 Chores. He likes chores. 
 Well, you could change the batteries in the smoke detectors. That would drive him crazy. 
 I'm just interested in you. 
 Did you do the laundry? 
 At least he can still clean the oven, so that's something. 
 Right here. 
 Sure do. 
 Sure did. 
 Oh, my God, you're still here? 
 Really? You have a needy Indian man in your house? 
 Yeah, Bernadette texted earlier. Raj is really getting on her nerves. 
 Howie, slow down. 
 If it's "vasectomy gone wrong" videos, he's seen them all. Including the one of the guy who's sitting on what appears to be a cantaloupe but is not.
 I thought he passed away. 
 Is he talking about himself? 
 You doing okay? 
 Where are you going? 
 There is no gift shop. Sit down. This was your idea. 
 This isn't a big deal. Stop whining. 
 Want me to go with you? 
 Other way, buster. 
 No. He's just saying, "Ow can these prices be so low". It's gonna be okay. A day or two of rest, and you'll be fine. 
 Um, let me go check on her. 
 Where did you get a bell? 
 Fun. Let me see. When you catch me, you can have it back.
 I can't. I got my 16-week checkup to get to, and then I'll pick up some Chinese for dinner. I'll take Halley with me. 
 No, it's fine. 
 Hi. 
 Good, but I have some news. 
 It's not twins. 
 The doctor said I was overdoing it, so she put me on bed rest just to be safe. 
 We're okay. 
 No, Howie's got it. He's fine. Right, Howie? 
 Or we can call Stuart. I'm sure he could close up the store, hop on a bus, and be here in no time. 
 No. No. 
 It's not that we don't trust you-- it's just you don't seem like much of a baby person. 
 Okay. Thank you. 
Yeah. Pretty soon, we're gonna have two crying babies in the house. 
 Well, let's just enjoy this quiet time while we still got it. Yeah. Yeah, it is really quiet. You think Penny's doing okay? 
 Penny, everything all right?! 
 I hope you're joking. 
 She's joking. 
 Want me to get it this time?
 This is fun. 
 Can you get us a little snack? 
  We trust you. 
 Now I feel bad. 
 Was that her first word? 
 Howard! Can you help me to the bathroom?! 
 And she still doesn't. So you're not gonna see her again? 
 Raj, do you real... 
 I don't think he is. 
 Is it pie and ice cream? 
 Hey, what are you two doing here?
 None of the girls at work like me enough to get me a gift. 
 I really appreciate the thought, but it's not necessary. I'll be back soon. 
 Thanks for coming! That b tch. 
 I'm talking about Ruchi. She's after my job. Why do you think she said, "Take all the time you need"? Because she was being nice? No, she's trying to steal my projects while I'm at home taking care of this useless plant and my dumb family. 
 I love you, too, but I could fling this card in your eye like a ninja throwing star. 
 Yeah, there's just something I need to ask you. 
 It's not be my birth coach.
 I need you to find out if Ruchi's trying to steal my projects at work while I'm on bed rest. 
 You're just saying that because she's sleeping with you. 
 I know I sound paranoid, but I'm feeling really vulnerable. If there's anything you could find out, it'd be great. 
 Nothing. I'll just calmly talk to her and explain there are certain boundaries that need to be respected. It's really for the benefit of everyone at the company. 
 So is she trying to steal my projects? 
 I'm gonna kill her. 
  I never would've undermined a coworker. What? 
 That was just a hilarious prank that ended with me getting a corner office. 
 It is thick. 
 Did she say something to you? 
 Let's just leave it at "I'm sorry." You're already sad. 
 Howard, I can hear you. The baby monitor is on. 
 It's not! 
 Get a laptop full of money? Why are you still here?! Go, go, go! 
 I'm not waiting on your table for you. 
 I'm so sorry to hear about you and Howard. Thanks. I just didn't think he was the kind of guy who would be doing weird stuff online. 
 Yeah, that's healthy. 
 Yeah, really breaks up the other 30 days I've spent on bed rest doing nothing. 
 You're gonna make me forget I've been stuck in bed while a baby uses my bladder as a kickball? 
 Huh? I'm listening. I'm listening. I'm not watching The Crown. 
 It's not for the baby; it's for Bernadette. She's feeling guilty about all the stuff she's missing with Halley. 
 How's the party coming? 
 Halley's awake and ready for her party! 
 Walk slow. It takes a while to get this bra back on! 
 It's really sweet of you to come by and keep me company. 
 I'm your girl. Lay it on me. 
 No, I tell him everything. Don't be a child. 
 Literally, nothing interesting. 
 Halley's napping! Keep it down! 
 Nice going. 
 You bought diapers, right? 
  What is happening? 
 Did it work? 
 You said you were taking a break from the band to help with me and the baby. 
 Pretty sure you're the weird friend in our movie. 
 Eight days. 
 Two days to cry. Six days to hit the gym. 
 Aw, that's sweet. I'm gonna give him an extra day of crying. 
 He told you all this at the planetarium? 
 You mean other than you? 
 Well, if you're uncomfortable with it, maybe stop sleeping with his wife. 
 Ooh. 
 That was just the baby kicking. 
 But this is good so far, really good. 
 Yeah. I have no idea who the killer is. 
 So, does Penny know you based a character on her? 
 Ilsa, the head of the institute. That's clearly Penny. 
 Really? Confident, ball-busting beauty who's always rolling her eyes at Logan? 
 "He looked at the stunning woman who was his boss and said..." 
 I don't know. She's pretty mean. 
 Exactly. 
 Wow. You are on fire. 
 I think you're neglecting your own motive, a massive inferiority complex. 
 Yeah. He's not smart enough to pull off a murder like this. 
 Boy, I don't know how people who aren't on bed rest keep up with the Kardashians. 
 Speaking of which, he came by yesterday to show me his book. 
 I liked it. 
 Oh, he was exaggerating. You're not really like that. 
 I don't know what to tell you. When I brought it up with Leonard, he said it was you. 
 Howie? Howie, wake up. It's time. 
 No. 
 No. 
 To the hospital. Today's my due date, and this crap needs to end now. 
 What are you doing? 
 Are you? 
 Go back to sleep.
 You know, I hear that s?x can induce labor.
 Hey. 
 That's done, but I've been on stair rest for the last 45 minutes. 
 Yeah. If you really want to help, put on a rubber glove, reach on up there and start pulling. 
 Oh, I just want this to be over. 
 I'll try, but I feel like bendy poses are what got me into this mess. 
 Sorry. I can't think of anything except how flat your belly is. 
 Go put on some more clothes, you bitch. 
 Yeah, hearing you is not the problem. Put that phone away! 
 All right, but just a warning. My feet are a little swollen. 
 What? 
 So what are you trying to say? It's my fault? 
 Let me guess. You're here to try to get me to go into labor. 
 Oh, that's nice. 
 Come on, baby. Get out here right now and I'll buy you a pony.
 Ah, come on! 
 Sheldon, I said I didn't want to play your game. Well, then don't think of it as a game. Think of it as a source of information about one of the lesser known campaigns of World War II. 
 You're right. That's so much better. 
 It's a desert. Isn't it gonna be hot?
 This is as fast as I move! Calm down! 
 I told you. 
  Oh, right. That was Amy. What's wrong with Michael? It's my dad's name.
 I didn't want to say this, but he's dying. 
 I don't even know anymore. 
 You're right. We both made this baby. 
 And I carried it, had to stay in bed for four months, sacrificed my body and my job, and soon it's gonna burst its way out of me like the Kool-Aid Man. 
 Okay, if it's not Michael, then what do you want to name him? 
 It doesn't bother you that I have an old boyfriend named Harry? 
 Same answer. 
 We're kind of busy. 
 What about Greg? 
 What about Paul? 
 Okay, you ruined it. 
 Sure. 
 Ooh!
 Uh, I think that was a contraction.
 No. We've been through this before. My water hasn't even broken yet. 
 Ew, no! 
 You know what, maybe we should go. 
 No. I'm just worried that Sheldon's gonna say "mucus plug" again. 
 Eh. But I am really excited to meet our son. 
 I'm sorry. That must be really painful for you. 
 Ooh, ooh, ooh. It's a big one. 
 Okay. Okay, I'm good. I'm sorry I tried to sneak the name past you.
 I'm sorry I used up so many good names in college. I was really competitive with my roommate.
 You know what, maybe we're putting too much pressure on this. It doesn't matter what we name him. He's gonna be amazing. 
 Yeah. He's gonna be smart and kind and funny. 
 But we're calling him Michael! 
  He's changing Michael.
 Really good. Except for when we went grocery shopping, and the checkout lady asked when I was due. 
 Oh, thanks, but we're really trying to enjoy this family time before we both go back to work. 
 So is Halley. 
 So is she. 
 Yeah. Oh, my God, he's so cute. 
 I just love them so much. 
 More than me? 
 That's sweet. But you should know, if you got seriously mutilated, I might dump you. 
 We're not putting a TV in the bathroom. That's how you get hemorrhoids.
 Oh great, so I have to give up my job and everything I've worked for? 
 Oh, so I have to abandon my children and go back to work, while you get to stay home and bond with them? 
 No, I don't want to have to, but if I want to, I should get to. 
 Maybe I do. 
 Well, I don't know, we can't both stay home. 
 Don't you think you should make more money? 
 You know what else is sexist, the phrase "suck it," yet, here we are. 
 Hey, where you been? 
 It's 8:00 a.m. Sleeping. 
  You're just trying to prove that you'd do a better job than me. 
 Howard, we both know you can't keep up this pace. By this afternoon you're gonna be passed out on the couch and I'm gonna have three exhausted babies to deal with. 
 Mm, fine. Maybe I'll have lunch with Penny. 
 Yeah, I just wanted to stop in and see my office before we went to lunch. 
 Yeah. 
 I've just been thinking that maybe I'd rather stay home with the kids and be a mom. 
 I know. 
 Oh, I'm not. I just came to meet Penny for lunch.
 Coffee sounds good. 
 Perfect. 
 It's weird. I've been away so long I don't miss any of this. 
 Fine. Put him on. Jerold, what's going on? Hope you're not screwing up my research. You calling from a bike ride? because you're backpedaling hard. All right, fine. E-mail it over. I'll take a look. Oh, sorry. Where were we? 
 Right, right. There's nothing in the world like holding your sleeping baby, knowing you make him feel safe and then-- Oh, good, you got the little cookies I like. 
 Why is Raj asleep on our couch? 
 What'd you do? 
 I-I do definitely want to, but I know how much this means to you and it was just one day. So, don't give up. 
 When I went by the office they gave me coffee and cookies and no one peed on me. I miss that so much. 
 I know. I took a two-hour nap on the couch in my office.
 How do you feel now? 
 Me, too.
 I love you, too. And we'll figure this all out. 
 Let's just do it right here. 
 If you knew how, why'd you wait 11 years? 
 That's great. When's he coming? 
 Bye, my babies, I love you. 
 Yeah, don't do that.
 Thanks for coming over. 
 Can I get you anything? Juice box? 'Naners? 
 Okay. 
 Bob the Builder. I'll catch you up. That one's Bob. He's a builder. 
 It's what we watch in this house. Bob the Builder, Dinosaur Train, and Peppa Pig, which is both funny and meaningful. 
  Sure. 
  Hang on, I-I just want to see if Bob can fix it. Yes, he can! 
 Thanks for getting me out of the house. I feel like my brain is turning to mush. 
 Did I show you the video of the kids sitting? 
 I'm sorry. 
 You know what? I don't want to be one of those moms who can only talk about her kids. 
 Oh, I'm in the middle of a book, too. It's three pages long and floats in the bath.
 It also quacks when you squeeze it. You should've seen Michael laugh. I think I have a video. 
 Sorry I talked about my kids the whole time.
 God. What's happening? I'm a smart, educated, successful... 
 I was gonna get it.
 I liked the old structure of my brain. But then, I liked a lot of my old structures. 
 I did stick a couple lamp chops in my purse. 
 But were you bored? 
 You're lying. 
 Now you're just being condescending. 
 The sun is losing about six times ten to the 12th grams per second, so the fraction of the mass it loses every year is about ten to the negative 13th. But don't worry. It'll be millions of years before we all freeze to death. Sweet dreams. 
 Amy made me realize that new mothers are cognitively primed to take in new information, and I've been wasting it making up songs about our babies' toes.
 Evolution gave me this mom brain to focus on the baby, but I figure I can hack it to learn all kinds of new things. 
 Yeah. There was a problem, and I fixed it. 
 Spoiler alert. I didn't see that one yet. 
 I mean, really, the bigger danger isn't the loss of mass. Instead, it will run out of hydrogen to use for nuclear fuel, swell up into a red giant, and fry the Earth. 
 No, thank you. But speaking of splitting things, did you hear about the light-splitting greenhouse film that could improve photosynthetic efficiency? 
 Just a little something I read while nursing a human being that I made. 
 Ah. N-E-K-C-I-H-C
 It does smell good.
 You know what, I'll go with you. And then maybe we just go home.
 What are you doing?
 Be careful, they don't make that bowl anymore. It's a nice one. 
 Aren't you worried there's some kid out there missing his drone? 
 Okay, then aren't you worried there's some rich Peeping Tom out there missing his drone?
 Did you check the video card? Maybe you can see where it started off from. 
 Like you two in a hot tub?
 That's not very much to go on.
 You just want to find her because she's cute.
 Hmm, let me have a look.
 Oh. There. Right there. Check out the pin on her jacket. Isn't that from the comic book store? 
 Yes. But I'm using a code where "yes" means "no." 
 Amy can't take him-- it's her bachelorette party this weekend. 
 Howard, you have to go and keep Leonard safe. 
 Uh, just say yes, or he's gonna want to come to the bachelorette party. 
 Just come on. 
 It's a quilting bee! 
 Isn't it perfect? 
 Pace yourself. Some more tea?
 What?
 Penny, she asked you a question. 
 Hey, we can make bad decisions. 
 Come on, let's go somewhere we can do body shots off shirtless bartenders. 
  Ooh. Hey there. Do you do body shots? 
 Mind your business.
 Amy? Amy? Should we get her home? 
 One more round! 
 There she is! 
 You don't remember anything? I remember taking some shots, and then... that's it. Oh, my gosh, did I pass out?
 You kind of did. At my own bachelorette party? I'm so lame. 
 Yeah, you did! 
 How about everybody?
 Oh, no, we would never do that to you. 
 Oh, thanks. Would you believe this is actually a dress from before I was pregnant? 
 Where's Stuart? I told him we had a 6
 Oh, it's okay. We can have date night another night. 
 We'll just have to divide and conquer. I'll go to dinner, and you can stay home with the Internet and have romance. 
  What's all this?
 Aw, that's so sweet. 
 Well, Stuart's not here and the kids are sleeping. I could wear nothing. 
 You know, we were just sitting down to dinner. 
 There goes date night. 
  What about the dinner you made? 
 You made canned soup for date night? 
 Oh, thank you.
 This is nice.
 It's just nice, okay?
 You look so beautiful.
 You know what they say
 Interesting thing about finger sandwiches
 What's wrong? 
 Wow. Look at your waist. Where you been hiding that thing?
 Are you having fun? 
 Also, wow. 
 Well, that was a successful trip. 
 She sure did. She found a dress that looked like... like it made her happy. 
 Yeah, we should make sure the photographer knows to just really... get in there. 
 That dress should be set on fire! 
 No, we can't. 
 No one wants that. 
 No, ya don't. 
 You mean like your dumb Cookie Monster tattoo? See? Was that fun? 
 Okay, but as long as we do it gently. 
 It's beautiful.
 I know, right? That was crazy.
 Uh, that's an easy one-- bad. 
 I'm sorry. Is this your first day being a girl? 
 I feel bad about hanging Penny out to dry. The truth is, I don't like the dress, either. 
 How many out-of-town guests are there gonna be? 
 Ooh, now it's starting to sound like a good wedding. 
 Um, their eye would be red, swollen and probably oozy. 
 Oh, no. 
 Get in the shower and then take those clothes and burn them. 
 To the wedding? 
 Aren't you worried it's a little intense to ask someone you just met to go to a wedding? 
 Like an escort service? 
 Oh, I get it... an escort service. 
 Stop meaning it. 
 Yeah, I got it, too. 
 I know, I have a problem. I just wanted to make sure you and Amy didn't get it. 
 Wear a veil? 
 What if we tell him the theme of the wedding is Walking Dead and this is our zombie makeup? 
 So, how was your date? 
 We're so sorry we ruined your date. 
 Yes!
 Great news! It's bacterial! 
 What are you doing?! Wash your hands! 
 Which one was that? 
 Oh, that was a good nap. 
 What the hell is that? 
 Good, because we don't need a dog. We already have two babies, you and Stuart.
