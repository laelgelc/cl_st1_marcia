 Oh, hey, Raj. What can I help you with? 
 Well, you came to the wrong place.
 No way! They're engaged? 
 Well, that's exciting news. Who would've thought Sheldon and Amy would be the next two to tie the knot? 
Okay. Uh... you know, they might like this. Superman and Wonder Woman, it's kind of romantic. 
 Literally everything. 
 I had that once. Turned out it was a tapeworm. 
 Why is that? 
Mm. This is-this is awkward. I, um, I was actually gonna close up a little early tonight because I have a date. 
 Yeah. 
 Don't be silly, I'm loving your pain.
 Hey! What are the odds? 
 Stuart. 
 I've also never been there. I've never been lots of places. Go on, quiz me. 
 Actually, I own my own store. Uh, I-if you'd like to check it out sometime, I'm running a new promotion-- buy anything, get taken out for a reasonably priced dinner. 
 Thank you. A-And, you know, Raj, I think it's great that you no longer live off your parents like a spoiled child. You live over someone's garage like a... failed adult.
 Why should I bow out? 
 That's what my doctor said, too, but I'm still here. 
 Because you're Indian? So just because she's brown, you get to date her? 
 Ruchi said she wanted to hang out with both of us. Why don't we just do that? 
 Also what my doctor said. 
 Hey, guys. 
 Mm. I believe that. 
 I can't believe you went behind my back! 
 You want to play a game of "who's more desperate" with me? because you're in the big leagues now, Bucko. 
 I'm not going anywhere. I'm like a fungus you can't get rid of. 
 Raj didn't tell me about tonight so he could be alone with you. 
 Uh, uh, uh, uh, Ruchi, I'm sorry. If you still want to hang out as friends, I'd like that. RUCHI
 And the fungus is under the toenail. 
 I'll take the baby. She's less emasculating. 
 Ah, thanks. They're all for you; I already had breakfast at Ruchi's. 
 So, you and Ruchi? 
 No, that's fine. You're my friend and I'm happy for you. 
 Plus, I don't know how you're gonna screw it up, but I know you will. 
 Oh, great, that's how you're gonna screw it up. 
 Mm-hmm. I should get a haircut; this thing's going south fast. 
 Hey, guys.
 Hey. I'm, uh, I'm running a special today, uh, buy something, keep having a comic book store to come to. 
 What's wrong with it? 
 Sounds like a lot of money, which we agreed to share because I-I was totally there. I remember now. 
 Oh, yeah, he and I totally remember. You tell them, Sheldon. 
 Hey, you guys. 
 Well, I don't know what that is, but it's got "coin" in it, and my cash register doesn't, so... yeah. 
 Sounds like the kind of money I'm familiar with. 
 Too rich for my blood. 
 Yeah, that's right! Up top! 
 Huh. What's that? Ooh, Batman flash drive. Pretty cool. Huh, if I erase this, I could probably resell it for, like, ten bucks. Things are finally going my way.
 Hey, Howard. 
 Where is everybody? 
  Wow, this conversation got mean fast. 
 Yeah? What's going on?
 Please, confidence is like red blood cells-- it's nice if you got some, but you don't need 'em. 
 That's right. I grew up in a loving, supportive household. This is all on me. 
 Great. And you can make fun of me all you want. 
 No, no, no. Go on. I can take it. My feelings, like my extremities, are basically numb. 
 Well, since it's you asking, I'm gonna guess that's not a euphemism.
 Come on, you guys have been friends forever. Quit fighting. 
 You two had a good run. 
 You bet. Plus, I live there and I was invited, so it's already better than my tenth birthday party. 
 Sure. What do you need? 
 Where do you and Halley go every week? 
 Don't stress about this party. She's one; she's not gonna remember. The other day I showed her her toe, and she was shocked. 
 All right. Uncle Stuart's got your back. Ain't no party like a Stuart party because Stuart's never invited to parties. 
 How you two feeling? 
 Oh, hey, Sheldon. Can I interest you in a cappuccino? 
 Oh, someone left it here, but it's still warm. Want to say four bucks? 
 Oh. Everything okay? 
 Sorry. 
 Well, if you really don't want to use your brother, I'd be your best man. 
 Yeah, we're friends. Plus, it'd be nice. Never really been called the best before. Or a man, for that matter. 
 My pleasure. I-I understand the best man usually receives a present. 
 Can never have too much Claritin. 
 It's okay. I was best man for two whole days. No one can take that away from me. Except for Sheldon, when he did. 
 Sold. 
 Not that much. 
 I don't mean to interrupt, but somebody's tracking blood everywhere, so-- never mind, it's me. 
 Great. I'm gonna have to clean that up. 
 We love you, too, Mommy. 
 El parque.
 I'm learning Spanish so I can talk to the other nannies.
 Bueno.
 Oh... No bueno. 
 Hola. How are you ladies doing? Raise your hands if you're bueno. Me llamo Stuart Bloom.
 Oh, sure, yeah. That's Cynthia. 
 Yeah, yeah, but I-I haven't seen her in a while. And before you say anything, there is a lot of reasons women stop coming here. It's not just me. 
 It was me. Yeah. I was trying out a flirty new smile.
 Yeah. I think I have her address on my mailing list. 
 She's not. 
 A little tip. Uh, stick with the smiles you know. 
 Oh. Look at that. Neil Gaiman tweeted about my store! 
 Uh, "Next time you're in Pasadena, check out The Comic Center. Great vibe, old school, the owner really knows his stuff." Isn't that amazing? 
 I have no idea. I think I would remember that. Obviously, vibranium is the most powerful metal in comics. 
 Uh, yeah, I think it's the enchantment that's powerful, not the uru, but, uh, thanks for playing. 
 Got another follower. I'm blowing up. 
 High double digits. 
 Mid double digits. 
 You guys want to see a real star, look over here. 
 I just got retweeted... by Patton Oswalt's brother. 
 Neil Gaiman, Nicolas Cage, Natalie Portman. The list goes on. 
 Unless I'm lying. 
 Hey, guys. That tweet actually got people to come in. Isn't that great? 
 Go sit on the couch. 
 Sorry. All out. Now you just let people come in and buy them? I didn't realize your soul was also for sale. 
 Well, it wasn't, but, uh, make me an offer. 
 Comic Center, where the real superhero is you. 
 Oh! Shoot. That was tonight. I forgot. The store's been really busy. 
 Um, I don't think I can. Listen to this. I-I was ringing up a customer, and I heard someone say, "Hey, there's a line," and I looked, and there was. 
 I am really sorry. I will make it up to you. But it won't be with a Val Kilmer Batman figurine because some sucker's buying that right now. Not you. This is great.
 Hey! 
  I was, but Denise has got it covered. 
 Oh... the funniest thing happened today. You know the, uh, receipt tape in the cash register? It ran out. I didn't even know it could do that. 
 Oh. Perfect timing. I'll go wash up. 
 Oh. Well, I know all about that. Step one is flunk out of art school. Well, why are you selling 'em? 
 Ah. How much do you need? 
 Well, I hope you have that rare Superman printed on the skin of actual Superman. 
 All right, let's see what you got. Huh. Is this a complete run of Todd McFarlane's Spawn? 
 Ooh, look at this. Giant-Size X-Men number one, Len Wein's relaunch of the franchise. 
 Okay, well, you know, I'm gonna have to open it to assess its condition. 
 You don't seem like you really want to sell these.
 Okay. Uh, why don't you leave these here with me, and I'll-I'll price 'em out for you. 
 Sure. 
 Hey, dude. 
 Yeah, you know, just want you to know that I don't think of you as a woman. 
 Great. So, as two genderless blobs of human flesh, how would you like to go to Sheldon and Amy's wedding with me? 
 You'll need to buy me a dress. 
 Uh, actually, Luke was on the Wookiee home planet, Kashyyyk, in the Holiday Special when he helped Chewie get home to his wife. 
 Her name's Malla. 
 Yeah. 
 Actually, they don't. I mean, the HAVw A5 turbo tank has metal gripping wheels, but I wouldn't call them tires. 
 Yeah, he answered 'em.
