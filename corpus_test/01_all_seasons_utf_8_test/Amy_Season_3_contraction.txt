 Excuse me. I'm Amy Farrah Fowler. You're Sheldondon Cooper.
 If that was slang, I'm unfamiliar with it. If it was literal, I share your aversion to soiled hosiery. In any case, I'm here because my mother and I have agreed that I will date at least once a year.
 I don't object to the concept of a deity, but I'm baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance.
 Noted. Now, before this goes any further, you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table.
 Tepid water, please.
