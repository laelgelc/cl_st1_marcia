 Yeah, because now Leonard and I get all this alone time. 
 Yes. Yes, you are. 
 Hey!
 You're gonna go on live  TV and admit you've seen that movie? 
 Real or Lego? 
 Oh, yeah, someone's definitely in there. 
 Hello?! Anyone in there?! 
 Oh, uh, Mr. Fowler. Sorry, we didn't know you were here. We-we actually thought someone was breaking in. 
 She doesn't have any plants. 
 Hey, did you even see Mamma Mia 1? 
 All right. I can't believe they canceled Vampire Diaries but they'll show this.
 And that was a woman torn between two hunky vampires. What is your point?
 Is that Amy's mom? 
 Mrs. Fowler, are you okay?
 Oh, we do.
 Well, don't tell him. 
 You happy? You smell like Amy's dad.
 Ooh, come on. 
 Wow, sometimes it's like you don't know me at all. See, he's not here. 
 Oh, yeah, now I smell him. 
 Well, there you go. What more can he say? 
 Aw. 
 I know. After they had Amy, she should've just eaten him and been done with it.
 I know, really, what did he ever see in her? He's so, so sweet, and she's such a ballbuster. 
 Yeah, but they seem to have nothing in common. 
 Wait, are-are you saying we are like them? 
 So you're the sweet, quiet one and I'm Amy's mom? Is that what you're saying? 
  Yup. Just need that extra jolt for a successful day of ballbusting.
 You know, you compared us to the strangest couple we know, and we know Amy and Sheldon, Howard and Bernadette, Raj and his twitchy little dog.
 Because it wasn't nice or because it wasn't true? 
 Oh, please. I-I'm serious. And I'm nothing like Amy's dad. He's a mousy little man who can't stand up for himself. My point is you're not like her, so we're not like them. 
 Well, 30 years from now, are you gonna hide from me because I'm so scary? 
 Aw. 
 Oh. I'm sure he didn't mean that. 
 Oh, please, you're just the right amount of bearing. Look, I know he loves you. If you just give him some space, I'm sure he'll come back. 
 Yeah, I do. You're a good person, Penny. 
 Me, too. 
 Hit the road. 
 Now! 
 Be quick about it!
 Well, guys, that was very, very thoughtful of you. I... Did you get me a double XL? 
 Hey. 
 Oh. 
 Well, yeah, that's great. Because when we saw it, we thought, "Amy and Sheldon just have to have that." 
 Of course he knows what it is. He's the smartest man in the world. 
 I know.
 Yeah. 
 In-in the locket?
 Where we hid it? 
 Are those words? 
 No.
 Really? Why? 
 Yeah. Plus, if we moved, we'd probably just get a loft downtown. 
 Oh, sure, yeah, that makes sense, so you could shoot hoops and mow the lawn? 
 He did. 
 Oh, that sounds so dry and clinical. 
 Wow, you really are good at this. 
 Ooh, read one. 
 No, I wouldn't say not at all. I mean, I am pretty spiritual. I do go to yoga, so...
 Pretty close. 
 Um, they're okay, I guess. I mean, if I saw one, I wouldn't throw a rock at it. 
 I just said I wouldn't. 
 Yeah-- someday. 
 Sure, uh, next question. 
 Hey, want to get lunch? 
 Oh, no, are they sick? 
 I get that. You know, I've been thinking lately that maybe I don't want kids. 
 You just said they ruin everything. 
 Hang on, why is it crazy to say I might not want kids? 
 Or I don't want them, so I won't have them, so back off. 
 Wow, I cannot believe how condescending you're being. 
 I know I'd be great, but the point is I don't want to be one. 
 You know, not everyone needs to have kids to be fulfilled. 
 Hey, Leonard, remember yesterday when we were talking about having kids someday? 
 Well, what if it wasn't someday. 
 No. No. No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
 No.
 What I meant was, what if, what if we didn't have kids? 
 I mean, our life is so great. Why would we want to change that? 
 Well, wait, don't be mad. 
 You have to-to turn the thing. 
 I'm gonna need more than that. 
 How is it any of your business? 
 They will find other friends. 
 This is between me and Leonard. 
 I'm about to be your barf buddy right now. Listen, when you have kids, I'm still gonna be there. I'm gonna be their fun Aunt Penny who gives them candy, and teaches them swear words and tells them stories about what a weirdo their mother is. 
 And it's gonna be hard to forget you said that. No. 
 Hey.
 I-I made you dinner. Your favorite
 I-I know it's not a baby, but it does leak when you pick it up. 
 No, look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to just drop all of this on you. 
 I know you did. 
 Are you sure that's enough? 
 You're really okay with this? 
 Hey, Daddy. 
 You were talking about all the things you thought you would never have, so I thought I would get you one. 
 No. No. No, no, no, no, no. I rented you the Batmobile for the day. 
 B-Be careful. I-I did not get the insurance. 
 Tell us the truth. Did she get you pregnant? 
 It's Penny.
 I thought you were pumping. 
 Okay, listen, I'm really worried about this whole Raj thing. 
 I know, right? You know, if this woman's gonna be around, I think we should check her out a little. I looked online. She doesn't have an Instagram, which means she's either 80 or something's wrong with her. 
 Would he do that?
 Is he in? 
 I thought you said he played by his own rules. 
 Yeah, I've fallen for that line before. It never leads to napping. 
 Oh. She's cute.
 Stop. Hi. We're Raj's friends. I'm Penny. This is Bernadette. We just came by to introduce ourselves. 
 She's smart. I like her. 
 Oh, I wish. That place is impossible to get into. 
 Wow. Okay, well, we'll see you tonight. 
 Okay. Bye. 
 This place is amazing. I can't believe you got us in here. 
 James?
 Oh, yeah, me, too. 
 Oh, hi.
 Tam, look. Sheldon's hugging me.
 Really, that's a thing? 
 Oh.
 Okay, are you trying to get us drunk so we'll dish on our friend? 
 He is great. 
 Mm-hmm. 
 So great. 
 There's really nothing to tell. Raj is so much fun to hang out with. He's like one of our girlfriends. And I mean that in a good way. 
 No.
 I mean, h-he takes baths with his dog, but not in a weird way. 
 He also cries every time Hugh Jackman sings. 
 But he is great. So great. Yeah. 
 I don't see you.
 No. 
 All I see is a yellow smudge. 
 Uh, because you're a boy and it's really funny. 
 Ugh, God, now I feel bad.
 You know, that's a good idea. Think she can get us into SoHo House? 
 Mm-hmm.
 They were passing notes to each other. 
 If you love math. 
 Well, you know what they say, you never collaborate as much as your first year of marriage. 
 Hey, don't dumb this down for me. 
 Leonard! 
 Well, uh, he was excited to talk science with Amy, but she was working late, so he decided to come over and share it with me. With me, Leonard. With me. 
 Yeah. I already got a man for that. 
 Yeah. 
 Okay, well, Leonard's here now. You can talk science with him. 
 Oh, that thing you were late for. One of us should really be there. 
 Really? That's gonna be our whole life, huh? 
 Oh, that's a nice surprise. What's the occasion?
 All right, lay it on us. 
 So just tell him you changed your mind and you don't want him to do it. 
 Wait, don't you mean four flights? 
 But we're on the fourth floor. I mean, you have the lobby, first floor, second, third, fourth. 
 That does not seem right. 
 Sorry, Raj, who cares if Howard tries to steal the show? All right? You're great at what you do. Just be the bigger man. 
 Can you just... Sorry, give me a minute? 
 Just shut up. 
 So when was the last time you saw Howard in his astronaut uniform? 
 Really? What was the occasion?
 What role do you play?
 Okay, that just made the next hour really weird.
 Switch with me. 
 Don't ask. 
 It's a tragedy. 
 Bernadette, why don't we get to dress up at work? 
 Oh, that would be fun. You know, I used to throw Halloween parties all the time when I moved into the building. 
 Please don't make this awkward for me.
 Okay. 
 Oh! Trick or treat. 
 Yeah, I am. I'm a pharmaceutical sales rep.
 Okay, failed actress who traded constant rejection for a Christmas bonus and a dental plan? 
 Oh. I will. 
 Why do girls' costumes have to be sexy but guys' costumes don't? 
 Very cute. 
 When I threw up in the pumpkin? 
 Really? That was pretty impressive. 
 No, no, our first kiss was at your birthday. Remember? I threw you a party, you didn't make it, and I felt bad for you. 
 If we're gonna go through every party where I felt bad for you, we're gonna be here awhile. 
 What? You're not mad at me, are you? 
 I was, like, four feet away. People cheered. 
 Really? We're still doing this? 
 Fine. It was on Halloween. 
  You got another way? I'm all ears. 
 Raj, take a break. 
 Well, people came, they ate, they vowed to never speak to each other again. I think it was a successful party. 
 No, it does matter. Okay? You were right. It was Halloween. I was dressed as a cat, you were a hobbit. It was right there on that couch. 
 Because I always hated that was our first kiss. I was drunk, and I was still with Kurt, and I was using you to make myself feel better. I... just wanted our first kiss to mean something. That's why I said it was the one on your birthday. 
 Thank you. Aw.
 Mm.
 Well, since you're here, you can help us clean up. Will you take this out, please? 
 Thank you.
 You are always welcome here.
  Mm-hmm. Where were we?
 Really? You never had a playhouse? 
 Well, that is how it feels. 
 Amy, make him stop.
 What's German for "annoying"?
 Wow. That was a little rough. 
 Hmm. But you're not, are you? 
 Wow, I really like this side of you.
 Yeah, just so decisive.
 Oh! 
 Yeah, you are.
 Hey. 
 You know, if it's that easy, then why does Leonard have to drive you to work every day? 
 Oh, you should have seen him-- denying things left and right. It was so sexy. 'Course, I made a request he did not deny. 
 Are you listening to me? 
 What is going on with you?
 Mm. Well, he thinks I've seen every one of the Star Wars movies, but I've really only seen the one with the gold robot.
 Exactly.
 Awful? No. Uh, strange? Yes. Sad? A little, yes. 
 That'd be a good slogan for a c?nd?m company. 
 So, you go home and sit alone in a toy house in the backyard?
 Ooh. Someone's making decisions.
 Yeah. Because you're the boss man, telling people what's what. I like it.
 Well, not with that voice.
 Cheers.
 Oh.
 You scared me. 
 Nothing. 
 What? No! Why would you even say that? 
 Thank you.
 I'm-I'm just running some errands. 
 I... Got to stay hydrated. 
 Okay, look, I'm sorry. We did not mean to leave you out. All right? Bernadette has been feeling fried at home, so we ended up hanging out in Halley's playhouse. 
 No! Just, like, a place to spend time that we don't tell anyone else about.
 Secret club. 
 What can I do to make it up to you? 
 Shh!
 Oh, I told him I was at yoga. 
 Yeah. Where does Sheldon think you are? 
 Me! Ooh, hot. 
 Okay, okay. Can we very quietly open that second bottle of... 
 What? No? 
 Oh. 
 Uh-huh. 
 Really? My parents love Leonard. 
 Fine, I'll sit on the floor. 
 Hi. 
 Yeah, Raj, you're gonna be fine. Just break out some of your Kama Sutra moves. 
 Look, she's probably nervous, too. 
 Raj, women can be bad at s?x, too. 
 Okay, is she there yet? 
 Raj, it's gonna be okay. Look, s?x isn't the most important thing in a relationship. My first time with Leonard was nothing to write home about.
 Yeah, but, you know, over time it got better. 
 Well, practice makes better. 
 Raj, calm down. You got this. 
 Just remember, the most important thing is to have fun.
 Hey, you look deep in thought. 
 About what?
 Oh, honey. Don't beat yourself up; it's great now. 
 Well, why would she think that? 
 So you've been using Sheldon as an excuse to get out of seeing your mother?
 Yeah. We-We've met her. Yeah. 
 Hey, Sheldon.
 What did he want?
 Ooh, what's the secret?
 Hey, ready for lunch? 
 Really, video games? Is this some sort of Freaky Friday thing where you're actually Howard?
 All right, great, can we go?
 You know, you make a lot more money than he does. Can't you just rub his nose in that?
 Here, let me try.
 Got him.
 Wow, I really wish I didn't see this. 
 Oh, my God. Is everything okay?
 Oh, man. Maybe leave an anonymous note, you know, like in high school, when you want to let your best friend know that her boyfriend's cheating on her.
 I don't know. Maybe you had a hickey.
 Trust me, it's not. I went to prom with a hickey and a black eye. Come on, knock on the door. You can do this.
 Oh, wait, just let me get inside.
 "Why"? Come on.
 So neither of them showed up for work today?
 Look, I'm sure they're fine. They were probably up all night coming up with a new theory.
 All right, well, they're already dead. There's nothing we can do.
 Hey... You guys look all comfy. Did-did you take the day off?
 Look, you guys, you had a, you had a setback, you know? This is the time you got to dig in and-and try harder. It's like halftime and you're down by seven.
 All right, it's-it's like Bat-halftime and you're down by Bat-seven.
 All right, Amy, listen...
 No.
 Like I don't care at all.
 All right, can we go eat now?
 All right.
 Okay, I'm-I'm gonna drive.
 Okay, Sheldon and Amy are still pretty upset about their theory being disproved. 
 Symmetry.
 Uh, SimCity-- sounds too much like symmetry.
 Russia or Russian in any context. The country, the dressing, the roulette. 
 We should just try and avoid anything that makes them think of their project or science or Nobel Prizes or successes or failures.
 Hey, guys.
 What you eating? 
 What? You can't have chicken fried steak first thing in the morning. 
 You or the steak?
 No, what's going on?
 Have you tried making him a cup of tea? 
 No, it's not.
 Oh.
 What? You didn't break it out when he declared his room a sovereign nation and waged a trade war against us? 
 Hey, Beverly.
 It's about Sheldon.
 Well, ever since his paper got disproven, he's been a wreck. He's been sad and... and angry. He just seems kind of broken. 
 Really? Over a theory?
 Yeah. What can we do to help him? 
 Hi. How are you guys doing? 
 Oh, that's funny. My high school was also the wolves. No? Not now? Okay. 
 Yeah, you know, we could say a few words, you could talk about what it meant to you and-and we could bury it somewhere. 
 What would you like to do, Sheldon?
 How about a bathtub and a match?
 Amy, would you like to shoot the arrow? 
 Oh! Oh! Oh! 
 Okay... 
 Champagne, a champagne, a champagne with a packet of Splenda in it.
 A waste of champagne?
 Yay. Boom.
 Good for you. People online can be so mean. I posted a picture of myself on Instagram, and some jerk said I looked so skinny I might disappear.
 Mm.
 
 Ugh. That sucks.
 You hear that? She needs a roommate.
 That was hard to watch.
 Oh, hey, how did your interview go?
 You don't sound very happy.
 Sorry.
 Uh, sure. Why not? All right, why don't you pick first?
 All right, I take Bernadette.
 Yeah, Because she's vicious and can hide behind a mushroom.
 Raj.
 I'll take Anu.
 All rightie.
 I will take... Stuart!
 What?! I'm not out. You didn't even shoot me.
 Oh, come on. It's not gonna hurt that bad.
 All right. Fine, you can shoot me.
 Ow! Ow! Aah, you were right. We're way too close.
 Hey. Who shot you?
 No.
 Ah, another reason why we don't do this more often.
 We're not gonna do anything.
 Zack! Hi. You guys know Zack.
 Did-did you send this over?
 Don't. Thank you, but you shouldn't have spent so much.
 Well, congratulations. 
 Yeah, that would be so nice.
 Oh, yeah.
 Hey. How was game night?
 That's funny. Wow. I should not have driven home.
 It was fun. Amy got drunk and kept telling us that Sheldon's chest is smooth like a porpoise.
 And we ran into Zack.
 He got married.
 Yeah, and he sold his company for a fortune and retired.
 Wait. You're not jealous of Zack, are you?
 Oh. You know, I'd like to go exploring.
 Mm-hmm.
 So, Marissa, how did you guys meet?
 Oh. So, you really like to read?
 Yeah, that's okay-- this is nice, sitting under the stars. It's actually kind of peaceful.
 I can't believe that guy's rich.
 I know, I know, I shouldn't be. He's super sweet. I should be happy for them.
 Really?
 Wha-- turns out we're both petty.
 Aw.
 Aw, thanks.
 Okay, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. You know, this has been such a nice evening. Let's all just stop before anyone says any more things.
 Aw, you said a thing.
 And also really weird, right?
 We... we get it, but... thank you for saying it out loud.
 Really? You don't know what to say?
 He means privately.
 Okay. You really think those two should be parents?
 And Leonard just stood there with a big, dumb smile on his face, like he was watching a puppy and a monkey make friends.
 It's not flattering. It's creepy.
 Really? So you'd be okay if someone wanted to use Sheldon as their sperm donor?
 Yes. We got in a huge fight about it. He said, well, if I don't want to have his baby, then why shouldn't someone else be able to? Do you believe that? What?
 So you're on his side?
 Hey.
 Just out.
 Really?
 I'll be right back.
 It's a sample cup.
 It's the closest thing I could find. It's a gesture. Shut up.
 I don't know, but... when I told you I didn't want to have kids, you didn't have a say in that, so... maybe I don't need to have a say in this.
 They couldn't have picked a better person. Are you calling Zack?
  Aw, remember when they only did it on her birthday?
 Wow.
 Is it that anti-itch cream you were testing on grad students?
 Oh.
 Well, congratulations. I'm so happy for you.
 Really? Me? Don't you want someone with more experience?
 Okay, well, thank you. Why don't we just chat about this at work?
 We'll see.
 Wait, what?
 Well, I know how to do the dishes. Just, sometimes I'm tired.
 Do you want to do this?
 You know, it was nice of Bernadette to offer, but I'm not sure it's the right move for me.
 Well, yeah, but it's not the most important thing. Aren't you always saying it's about the work, not more money or a better title?
 Plus, I'd be working for Bernadette. I don't know if that's a good idea.
 What the hell is that supposed to mean?
 Hey, you got a sec?
 Uh, bad news. I spoke to my supervisor about heading up your sales team, and she said she just can't lose me right now.
 No, no. No ripping. Um, anyway, I-I don't want to leave her shorthanded, so I'm sorry.
 Oh, thank you.
 I know. Just, ugh!
 Oh, no, I'm sure, definitely sure. Don't call her. But, you know, just, ugh, why?
 Hey, you wanted to see me?
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Do I have to?
 Really? Oh, you know, you should know, she's been taking our new antidepressant, and lying is one of the main side effects.
 No, it's not that.
 Honestly, I don't know if I'm up to it. You know, the last project I managed was my high school yearbook.
 And that was the year we didn't have one. Apparently, the printers won't make them without getting paid.
 Uh, if I didn't know then, I'm not gonna magically know now. Plus, you know, I didn't go to college. I'd be in charge of people that are far more educated with more experience; what if they don't listen to me?
 What, even you?
 Mm, that may have worked on you, but she's too smart for that.
 Hey. How long have you been sitting there?
 I'm not changing my mind, Bernie.
 Thank you.
 What... Karen? Well, what's the job? Eating my yogurt and then lying about it?
 Well, I'm smarter than Karen. I can read the word "Penny" on a cup of yogurt.
 I am up to it. I'm just nervous about it.
 I know what you're up to.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 All right, now, I'm sure some of you are wondering, "Who is this woman? "How did she get to be in charge of the sales team? Is it because she's friends with Dr. Rostenkowski?" Because she is. "Is it because she was Miss Cornhusker and still fits in those very same jeans?" Because she was, and she does, and they're actually a little baggy. Or is it because she's the best damn salesperson here? Because I am. Now that we're clear on that, here are the drug specs and marketing strategy for Inflamminex. Which, now that I say it out loud, might be a placeholder. By tomorrow, I want everyone to have this committed to memory.
 You want to have a contest, Karen? Winner gets a yogurt.
 All right, now we all know what we need to do. Let's go do it. R-Right now. Get out of here. Go. 
 Damn right it was impressive.
 Sorry, boss.
 Well, Amy, looks like the elevator might have been the high point of your day.
 Mm. I'm sorry your friends won't let you play kerf with them.
 What was wrong with "dust"? Are you sure you're not just a little jealous?
 Oh, well, it's their loss. Look, why don't you go to bed. I'll run out and get you some medicine.
 Really? You're taking medicine from Stuart? Doesn't he need, like, all of it?
 All right, well, why don't you go to bed. I'll sleep out here on the couch.
 Even better. Sweet dreams, snot bag.
 Leonard. Leonard!
 You're having a bad dream.
 Let me see if you're running a fever.
 Oh, yeah, you're burning up.
 Geez! Are you okay?
 I don't know, brown? No, green. No, wait, brown.
 Yeah, and we don't find it weird at all.
 No, no, it's not gonna look... Sure.
 Oh, we know you will. So, what is the next step?
 Uh, I think that also means no flying solo.
 Still just totally not weird.
 Hey. What are those?
 Zack used the word "virility"?
 Okay, that's my dad. Now, remember, do not bring up any baby stuff, all right? Not me not wanting one, not you having one with Zack.
 And if he brings it up, change the subject to literally anything else.
 But not the Cornhuskers. Do not discuss the Cornhuskers.
 Never mind, you're good. Daddy! Hi.
 Aw.
 Dad, uh, come on in, sit down. Can I get you something to drink? Maybe a beer?
 Okay.
 Um... Leonard wants to have a baby with my ex-boyfriend Zack.
 I think this is going pretty good, huh?
 Oh, I'm sorry. I panicked. He was judging me.
 I know. It worked.
 In high school, he could hear me open a can of beer in my closet under a blanket.
 It's strange here, too, and we have a bakery for dogs.
 I support my husband.
 But, you know, if you think differently, you should feel free to say so. You know, just like, "Ah!" Make a scene.
 You do?
 No, no, this is... this is a little different than that...
 You have fun with your new best buddy?
 Well, he was right about one thing. I am married to a stud.
 Yeah, I felt so bad about selling you out, I thought I would maybe make it up to you.
 Oh. That's right. I forgot. All right, well, guess I'll just read a little and then-- I don't know-- go to sleep.
 Oh, you want me to take it off?
 All right. Well, then pipe down and let me read my comic book.
 Ooh, listen to this. "Bam. Pow. Take that, Batman."
 Hey.
 Yeah. Well, I was in the zone. You know, and then in a diner and then in a massage chair at the mall where I fell asleep.
 Well, I took a nap next to Hot Dog on a Stick. What do you think?
 Why would I be mad at myself?
 You know, it's pretty crappy of you to make me feel bad about this.
 Yes. I feel like I'm letting everybody down. Hate disappointing Leonard, but I really hate disappointing you.
 And I'm sorry about that.
 I said sorry.
 Yeah. I was there. I remember. Parts of it.
 What about Randall and Lisa?
 I know.
 Thanks.
 Hey.
 Oh, Leonard, it's okay. We talked. We're good.
 Could've let you go longer.
 Really? But you were so excited about it.
 I know you would.
 "And the absence of side effects means that Inflaminex can be taken in conjunction with other medications. It's a brand-new day." Such a good tagline, I forgot, who came up with that?
 That's right, I did. Okay, I know it's late and I've been working you guys really hard, so I have a little treat for you.
 No. You get to stay here and get vitamin B shots.
 All right, fine. Go, get out of here. Go on. I think things are going pretty good.
 Yeah, I told him if he's gonna be a crybaby, go to the break room. I just really want to be prepared for this conference.
 You really think so?
 I know. I didn't know what to wear, so I brought a few options.
  I just really want this weekend to go well.
 I love you.
 Aw. That reminds me of what I said to you the first time we slept together.
 Yeah.
 I'm just going for the weekend.
 Yes.
 I'll see what I can do.
 As opposed to the leading nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, our product greatly reduces the risk of ulcers. So it won't burn a hole in your stomach. 
 Okay. I got this.  Thank you for stopping by. It's a brand-new day!
 Yeah. Mediocre actress, great drug pusher. Who knew?
 Well, we...
 Well, ours has zero drug interaction risk.
 Okay. Let's everyone calm down. If you can't find a pill for that here, then you're not trying hard enough.
 Well, you scared the bad man away. Who's a good girl?
 Thank you. It's a brand-new day.
 I know. But not as big as that booth. What's going on over there?
 Hey, I thought we weren't supposed to have our phones in the booth.
 Hey, can I help you?
 Ah, yes. It's right next to the laxative booth. Clever, right?
 Oh, yeah. Uh, Danny, right? How's your launch going?
 No, she stepped out for a call, although I wouldn't be surprised if she's in line to meet Ray Liotta.
 Yeah. Something tells me that, too, and it was her.
 Really?
 Uh, thanks, but I'm pretty happy.
 Tell it to your shrink, Karen.
 Oh, I don't know. I'm pretty busy. I have to inventory all the giveaways.
 Nothing.
 Dammit, Karen.
 I can't believe we're still talking about this. He handed it to me. What was I supposed to do?
 You are not serious.
 Did it?
 I don't know. It's kinda flattering.
 Or he's trying to get to me because I'm really good at my job.
 You know, our brand recognition is three times higher than theirs. And I did that with a stupid product name and no assistant.
 Well, you know who's begging me now? Danny.
 I thanked you by thanking you. And I sent you that fancy box of pears.
 Danny. Danny, look at me. Does this face sell fungal creams? No. This face is cholesterol drugs and above.
 No one's ever accused me of that before.
 Ooh, are-are you gonna write it on a napkin and slide it over to me?
 Aw. 
 Yah.
 Yeah, he's writing it on a napkin like in the movies.
 Aw. You think I'm amazing?
 You do not want that, she's a biter.
 You know, I don't have to. Thanks, but I'm happy where I am. Let's go. Can I just see what he wrote on the napkin?
 "And the absence of side effects means that Inflaminex can be taken in conjunction with other medications. It's a brand-new day." Such a good tagline, I forgot, who came up with that?
 That's right, I did. Okay, I know it's late and I've been working you guys really hard, so I have a little treat for you.
 No. You get to stay here and get vitamin B shots.
 All right, fine. Go, get out of here. Go on. I think things are going pretty good.
 Yeah, I told him if he's gonna be a crybaby, go to the break room. I just really want to be prepared for this conference.
 You really think so?
 I know. I didn't know what to wear, so I brought a few options.
  I just really want this weekend to go well.
 I love you.
 Aw. That reminds me of what I said to you the first time we slept together.
 Yeah.
 I'm just going for the weekend.
 Yes.
 I'll see what I can do.
 As opposed to the leading nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, our product greatly reduces the risk of ulcers. So it won't burn a hole in your stomach. 
 Okay. I got this.  Thank you for stopping by. It's a brand-new day!
 Yeah. Mediocre actress, great drug pusher. Who knew?
 Well, we...
 Well, ours has zero drug interaction risk.
 Okay. Let's everyone calm down. If you can't find a pill for that here, then you're not trying hard enough.
 Well, you scared the bad man away. Who's a good girl?
 Thank you. It's a brand-new day.
 I know. But not as big as that booth. What's going on over there?
 Hey, I thought we weren't supposed to have our phones in the booth.
 Hey, can I help you?
 Ah, yes. It's right next to the laxative booth. Clever, right?
 Oh, yeah. Uh, Danny, right? How's your launch going?
 No, she stepped out for a call, although I wouldn't be surprised if she's in line to meet Ray Liotta.
 Yeah. Something tells me that, too, and it was her.
 Really?
 Uh, thanks, but I'm pretty happy.
 Tell it to your shrink, Karen.
 Oh, I don't know. I'm pretty busy. I have to inventory all the giveaways.
 Nothing.
 Dammit, Karen.
 I can't believe we're still talking about this. He handed it to me. What was I supposed to do?
 You are not serious.
 Did it?
 I don't know. It's kinda flattering.
 Or he's trying to get to me because I'm really good at my job.
 You know, our brand recognition is three times higher than theirs. And I did that with a stupid product name and no assistant.
 Well, you know who's begging me now? Danny.
 I thanked you by thanking you. And I sent you that fancy box of pears.
 Danny. Danny, look at me. Does this face sell fungal creams? No. This face is cholesterol drugs and above.
 No one's ever accused me of that before.
 Ooh, are-are you gonna write it on a napkin and slide it over to me?
 Aw. 
 Yah.
 Yeah, he's writing it on a napkin like in the movies.
 Aw. You think I'm amazing?
 You do not want that, she's a biter.
 You know, I don't have to. Thanks, but I'm happy where I am. Let's go. Can I just see what he wrote on the napkin?
 Yeah, you should've seen her take down John Krasinski last week. Got him to admit he loved his wife. It was brutal.
 Not a pull-up.
 Someone texting you?
 By doing the dishes?
 What's up?
 Uh, I think so. Let me see. Yeah, we've got, uh, chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin.
 No. "Unfortunately, Sheldon..." that's all you got to say.
 Yeah, they're pretty smart. Don't you think they're gonna realize it's just a bribe?
 Thank you for pointing that out, Sheldon.
 So none of them are coming to the reception?
 Okay, what did he say that was so insulting?
 Damn.
 Hi.
 Okay, look, Sheldon's a pain in the ass. But Dr. Fowler's really nice. So if you average them out-- math... ...you got someone who's okay.
 Yes, because of your work on gravitational waves.
 I do. But I'm-I'm really hogging this conversation. Leonard?
 Yeah, you know, and I don't need to tell you that gravitational waves are disturbances in the curvature of space-time. Or that the-- Hey, you worked on the movie Interstellar?
 You are welcome. 
 Yeah, now get out of here, go talk to some smart people.
 Yeah, sorry. Sometimes I forget you're smart because you're so sexy.
 Yeah.
 Uh-oh. I haven't been to a lot of parties like this, but what does a physics rumble look like?
 Wow, that's a big deal.
 Doesn't he know how to solve those?
 Really? This thing has numbers?
 Sweetie, you just need to relax. You know what I like to do?
 Hey, don't knock it until you've wasted a couple hundred hours of your life.
 Hey, how about a massage?
 Okay, well, what about Reiki? It's like massage but without touching.
 Well, I place my hands near your body and allow the universal energy field to manifest its healing powers. Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but it really works; ask Leonard.
 What do we push if we feel uncomfortable?
 Hey, Amy. Relaxed?
 Well, I don't see what else you could've done.
 Sheldon, maybe you don't know what to do because Amy's always taking care of you.
 That's what you heard?
 Well, that doesn't give us much time to eat.
 Six toes per foot or six toes total?
 No. Sweetie, you shouldn't do things that make you feel bad.
 How's your headache?
 Mm. I'm so sorry you missed the end of the movie.
 Well, to be fair, you talked about the bathroom so much, we felt like we saw that, too.
 Well, then, why did we sit so close?
 Sweetie, you have got to stand up for yourself. You know, maybe Sheldon's right. Maybe you are that word he said.
 Yeah, that! That's the one. Boy, sounds way more made-up when you say it. I mean, come on, when was the last time you did something totally selfish without worrying about what anyone else wanted?
 How is that selfish?
 Great.
 Wow, sex with your wife. You're really swinging for the fences there, Hofstadter.
 No! I like it. Let's go.
 All right. Well, just a warning, I might be on my phone for most of it.
 That's because it's barbecue.
 Don't take this the wrong way, but yes, it was.
 Oh. Well, this... looks great.
 Well, no, it's got a nice, you know, science-y heft to it. I... Really proud of you, sweetie.
 Sheldon, if this is what he wants, he should ask for it. I mean, what's the worst that happens?
 Wait, you're gonna quit?
 W... In the world? I can't even get you to go to the beach, and now you want to move to the world?
 Okay, don't you think threatening to quit your job is something you should run by me first?
 I meant feelings about things that I don't care about!
 Not now.
 Of course I want you to be happy.
 Hey. How did it go?
 What, so you got the job?
 So you quit? Okay, Leonard, I can't move. I just bought a six-month membership to SoulCycle.
 Then he changed his mind?
 I'm really confused about how to react to this story.
 You're gonna have to tell me.
 Yay! Oh, I am so happy for you.
 Oh. Let's celebrate. What do you want to do?
 Hey, you want to go to SoulCycle with me?
 Yeah.
 Hang on. I don't think it's fair to use something someone did in school against them.
 Okay, now you just sound crazy.
 And a few of us who did, but it's only Because The Scarlet Letter was so boring.
 Yeah, well, maybe he's changed.
 Well, that didn't ruin your life.
 Look, I'm proud of Sheldon and Amy. You know? They want to win this thing on their own merits, not by knocking out the competition.
 I don't like the idea of them losing either, but this is their decision to make, not ours.
 What do you mean?
 Really? You'd do that?
 Just realized I've never actually seen your hands dirty.
 You sure you're not thinking about your husband?
 Oh. Well, that doesn't mean anything. I mean, Leonard has resting guilt face. Yeah, it's-it's like, "What are you guilty about, Leonard?" "Nothing." "Well, then, tell it to your face." 
 I'm so okay, yeah.
 Okay, look, Leonard knows that you and Sheldon decided to take the high road, so he went to Kripke for you. But that just means you didn't do anything wrong, and now you don't risk losing to those idiots.
 But you wanted me to.
 I wanted to be a princess.
 Fine. I'm sorry I told you.
 What? You told him?
 Yeah, that's-that's probably where you heard it.
 Never? Isn't that usually when you go to the gym?
 Come on, she gave birth to you.
 Good, I'll go with you.
 We're not gonna talk about you.
 Yeah, if you like photons and how they get entangled, he's your co-guy.
 Night, Beverly. Wow, she's being really nice.
 Or you accomplished something great, and she's genuinely proud.
 Beverly, I have to say, it's so nice seeing the two of you get along.
 Still, it made him so happy showing you around his lab yesterday.
 Hmm, multiple choice. Um, I'm-a go with D
 Well, I may have had a little something to do with it. I mean, how often do you wear your superhero underwear now?
 Yeah, that was all me. That was me.
 Uh, "observe"? What is going on?
 You know, Leonard was really upset. Shouldn't you go talk to him?
 Beverly, put down your phone and go apologize to your son. Oh, so now you're not talking to me?
 Yep, bye.
 Really hope you're almost to zero.
 Yep. I'm with you. Leonard, coffee?
 I'm too tired to even be disturbed by that. Sheldon?
 Well... should we wake him up?
 Oh, boy.
 Because I called it.
 Oh, and you've earned it?
 Fine. Don't miss.
 Oh, wait. Hang on. When you're old, you are gonna want a record of this.
 Ready... go.
 All right, now what?
 Congratulations!
 Can you believe it? They finally fixed the elevator.
 What's with him?
 Oh. Yeah, got it.
 The elevator. It's really fast.
 All right. You need a ride?
 I'm playing a drinking game. Every time you say the word "change," I take a slug.
 Mm. Not unless you change the subject. Huh. Now I said it. Meh. Hmm. You know, you're the only person who could win the biggest prize in science and still be upset about it.
 Okay. Fine, I'll stop playing. You know, you go on and on about wanting things to stay the same, but you've changed a lot since I met you.
  I'm serious. You have a ton of friends, you got married, moved into a new apartment, you wore a baseball hat that one time. Heck, you've had sex almost as many times as I have fingers.
 W...
 You dog!
 Oh. Mm-hmm. You know, I've grown, too. I used to be the bartender back there.
 Well, judging by the look on her face, it's at least one percent saliva.
 So, I guess the only thing that actually stays the same is that things are always changing.
 Well, there's a little more to it than that, but, yeah, sure.
 Okay, I'm drinking again.
 Hang on. What do you think? Want to give it a try?
 Get in!
 Hey, babe.
 Well, thank you guys so much for the clothes and the shoes, the plane tickets. You've been so generous.
 No. She was so happy, she didn't even question it.
 No, it's too early. I haven't even wrapped my head around it.
 Yeah, well... if something else had been wrapped, we wouldn't be in this situation.
 attacked you? I said, "Do you wanna?"
 Uh-huh.
 Well, I can't get more pregnant.
 Oh. Do we have to go?
 Relax. I'm not gonna drink.
 Wha...? No. No, I just, you know, I don't like to drink when I fly.
 Oh, my God. Yeah, great. Whatever. Uh-huh.
 Yeah, get in, get in, get in.
 Uh-oh.
 What's the matter?
 What's going on?
 What?
 Oh. Should we tell him?
 Yeah. Doesn't answer my question.
 I'm pregnant, Sheldon.
 I didn't tell anybody.
 It was an accident. I went out drinking with Sheldon.
 No. Then I went home and slept with Leonard.
 Leonard. And a little Idris Elba. I mean, ah...
 Come on, you didn't seriously expect him to react like a normal human being.
 Oh, my God!
 Pickled herring. Who knew how good it was!
 Sounds gross. Looks gross. Smells gross. It's delicious! Ooh, that might be my salted cod!
 Oh, wait. Do I get a vote in this?
 Bye-bye.
 Okay, that's it for the fish. We'll be back with the meatballs after a short word from our sponsor. Oh, thank you. Leonard, I can't go home. I have to be there for Amy.
 It's so strange. No matter how thoughtless and selfish he is, I still love him.
 Like when you make pancakes and the first one comes out a little wonky.
 Wait, what?
 Is Michael okay?
 Oh, I just need, like, five or ten minutes.
 No. What is wrong with you?!
