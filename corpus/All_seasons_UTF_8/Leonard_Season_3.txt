 Oh, thank God we’re home.
 I’m going to go let Pennyy know we’re back.
 Yeah, I just stopped by to say… Yeah, so, hi!
 I missed you, too.
 Me, neither. Except for one night when the heat went out. Long story, it’s… don’t ask.
 Do not make a sound.
 Damn his Vulcan hearing. Not a good time, Sheldondon.
 Yes, I feel terrible about it. I will never forgive myself, I don’t expect you to either, and I would really appreciate it if you would leave me with Pennyy for a session of self-criticism and repentance.
 It was the only way to make him happy.
 Because when he wasn’t happy, we wanted to kill him. There was even a plan. We were going to throw his Kindle outside, and when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death.
 No, the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled dog teams and yell mush. Look, we kept the original data. You can still publish the actual results.
 Aw, see, yeah, you probably shouldn’t have done that. So write another e-mail, set the record straight, it’s no big deal.
 Yeah, I feel terrible.
 What? Uh, he’ll be fine, the guy’s a trouper, come here.
 Man, I cannot catch a break.
 Well, he came out of his room this morning wearing his Darth Vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the Force, so I’d say, a little better.
 Howardrd…
 Well, tell your genitals what I do with Pennyy is none of their business.
 Sheldondon, over here.
 Sheldondon, why are you sitting by yourself?
 Come on. We said we were sorry.
 So much for our friendship with Sheldondon.
 Hey. Listen, since we got, you know, interrupted last night, I didn’t have a chance to give you this.
 It’s a snowflake. From the North Pole.
 Uh-huh. It’ll last forever. I preserved it in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin.
 It’s actually a pretty simple process. You see, cyanoacrylate are monomers which polymerize on… 
 Man, I can not catch a break.
 Okay, well, thanks for letting me know.
 Of course I’m going to do something. Uh, Howardrd, you check the comic book store. Raj, go to the Thai restaurant. I’ll stay here with Pennyy in her apartment. Oh, damn it. It’s Sheldondon’s mother. A break cannot be caught. Hi, Mrs. Cooper. He is? Sheldondon went home to Texas. Yeah, no, I know he resigned. Yes, I guess it kind of is our fault. No, no, no, you, you’re right, someone needs to come talk to him. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it. Yeah. All right. New plan. Howardrd, you and Raj go to Texas. I’ll stay here with Pennyy in her apartment.
 Well, you know, I gave you the snowflake and we were kissing and… Oh, come on, I don’t want to go to Texas!
 Trust me, you’ll be fine. See ya.
 Yeah, but I already saw him naked. Just come here.
 Really?
 Maybe you can.
 I can’t believe you bought a red cowboy hat.
 Saloons?
 What can I tell you? They probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass Costco over there.
 Will you please take that stupid hat off?
 We took the red-eye.
 Uh, no, thank you.
 Uh, if you don’t mind, Mrs. Cooper, there’s a 3:05 nonstop back to Los Angeles, and you have no idea how much I want to be on it.
 Uh, yes, ma’am.
 We came to apologize.
 And bring you home. So, why don’t you pack up your stuff and we’ll head back.
 No, this is my home now. Thanks to you, my career is over and I will spend the rest of my life here in Texas trying to teach evolution to creationists.
 How about that? I finally caught a break.
 You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?
 Why does it have to get weird?
 I mean, we were friends, and now we’re more than friends. We’re whatever this is. But why label it, right? I mean, it is what it is and…
 Yeah?
 Totally.
 Hey, guys.
 What do you mean? It’s new comic book night.
 There’s more to life than sex, Raj.
 Nothing flamed out. We don’t have to have sex every night, you know.
 It’s not a matter of opportunity. We’re getting to know each other. There’s a learning curve.
 Nothing like that happened, all right? The sex was just fine.
 I’m not saying it was bad, I’m just saying it… wasn’t great.
 To tell you the truth, I think we were both a little, I don’t know…
 All I know is, it wasn’t the way I dreamed it would be.
 Sheldondon, dinner’s here.
 No, we went somewhere new.
 No, look, Mumbai Palace.
 Trust me, this will be just fine.
 What’s that supposed to mean?
 I don’t know
 Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.
 Pennyy, wait. Aagh! What is wrong with you?
 Please don’t be mad.
 Nothing bad, just that last night was fine.
 Yeah, it’s a perfectly good word. You put it in front of wine or dining, and you’ve really got something. Okay, well, let me ask you this, how was last night for you?
 Okay?
 So, you’ve been through this before?
 Okay-dokay.
 So much.
 Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid.
 More wine?
 What are we drinking now?
 Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?
 What?
 Schnapps. You’re right, that is fun.
 I’m okay. Just a little mouthwash, and then I’m gonna rock your world. Are you okay? 
 God, I had the most horrible night.
 I bet I could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends.
 Hey. What’s going on?
 Wait a minute. You talked to Pennyy about our sex life?
 Right, right. You’re saying you talked to Pennyy?
 Interesting.
 Excuse me.
 Little bit.
 Hey. Uh, what did Sheldondon say to you?
 Is that what you want?
 I guess.
 It would, wouldn’t it?
 Good, good.
 Okay-dokay
 Morning.
 Sorry. I haven’t given her your schedule yet.
 We did, but there were extenuating circumstances.
 No, her bed kind of… broke.
 Perfectly formed miniature human being.
 Don’t do that.
 Sheldondon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with Pennyy.
 I’m just saying, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
 It’s a…
 Wow!
 Sheldondon! it’s an amazing coincidence, can we leave it at that?
 Come on, you guys, let it go.
 What was that?
 It does. But in my experience, you don’t.
 Yeah, yeah, now that’s you, obnoxious and insufferable.
 Howardrd, what did you do?
 Why are you carrying extras?
 In this case, you bet she is.
 They’re gonna get beaten up at that club.
 Oshikuru:  Demon Samurai.
 Okay, I know what you’re doing.
 Yes, you’re using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour.
 No, I don’t want any chocolate! Sheldondon, you can’t train my girlfriend like a lab rat.
 Well, you shouldn’t.
 No, this has to stop now.
 No, you’re not sanding Pennyy.
 Yes, you’re forbidden.
 What could she possibly be talking about for so long?
 No.
 You’re not squirting her in the face with water.
 Forget it.
 I’m not. And Pennyy’s qualities, both good and bad, are what make her who she is.
 Yes.
 You’re not changing how Pennyy laughs.
 Unbelievable.
 I was just thinking, we should probably turn in too.
 Really, that’s a lot of work, and it’s kind of late.
 Let’s go.
 What do you mean?
 Hey.
 We’re watching Goonies, Gremlins and Young Sherlock Holmes. They were all written by Chris Columbus.
 What’s he on trial for?
 Oh. I’ll be there.
 So, what’s going on with Raj?
 What do you mean, he’s getting deported?
 So, what’s going on?
 So, wait, what have you been doing for the past six months?
 Don’t worry, you’ll find another job.
 I’ve always been a little confused about this. Why don’t Hindus eat beef?
 Yeah.
 Wait, are you saying that he discriminated against you? Because we should file a complaint.
 Hey.
 Excuse me, Sheldondon, how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?
 Uh-huh. Now that Raj is working for Sheldondon, I don’t have to chauffeur him around anymore. Plus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy.
 What are you thinking?
 You are a dirty girl.
 Hi, Howardrd.
 Little bit, yeah.
 Uh-huh.
 You know, whatever.
 That was fun. Thank you.
 Oh. Okay. Tomorrow you’re going to get a card in the mail. Just throw it away.
 What are you doing here?
 Yeah, okay. Um, Howardrd, we need to talk.
 Uh, please understand that it’s not that we don’t want you around, but Pennyy and I occasionally need some alone time.
 Thank you. There’s lox and cream cheese in the fridge, the bagels are in the oven, I was warming them up.
 Good.
 I don’t know. What do you want me to do?
 Are you sure?
 Okay. Howardrd come back.
 Okay, well, then I’ll just cut your vines with my ruby sword. That’s right, I did it. I cut ’em.
 Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf, elf beats water sprite, and basically everything beats enchanted bunny.
 Just play a potion card.
 Sheldondon, don’t ruin the game.
 See? Ruined.
 Sheldondon has kind of a photographic memory.
 Why?
 See ya. Still can’t believe she’s going out with me.
 What?
 Yeah, I don’t remember that.
 Oh, yeah.
 Howardrd, you can’t hold me to that.
 Because when I made that agreement, I didn’t think I’d ever have a hot girlfriend. And I was positive you never would.
 Oh, damn it. Can I have a napkin?
 But you have a whole bunch of ’em.
 No, I haven’t.
 Because I’ve been busy, because I haven’t figured out a way to bring it up, and mostly, and I can’t stress how key this is, because I don’t want to.
 It’s not that simple. What am I supposed to say? Pennyy, do you have any friends you’d like to never hear from again?
 Fine. I’ll ask if she has a friend for you.
 Right.
 I’ll see what I can do.
 Are you kidding? I couldn’t even talk him into giving me one of his freakin’ napkins.
 Not really. I googled how to do that. So, listen, have you ever made a pact with someone?
 Okay, fine, like a pinky swear.
 Yeah, I’m familiar with Bert and Ernie.
 Over puppets?
 Okay. Speaking of what the heart wants, um, a long time ago, I made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves you.
 No, no, nothing like that. The deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend, we’d have her fix the other one up with one of her friends.
 Well, I sure as hell wasn’t going to bring it up before sex, and during, I was trying to remember what I read on google, so…
 Come on, it doesn’t have to be a good friend. And you know that deep down inside, Howardrd’s a really nice guy.
 Will you at least think about it? Just as a favour to me?
 Girls don’t count Klingon, Howardrd. Right?
 Another delightful surprise for her.
 Gonna be a long night.
 I had to ask. You didn’t have to say yes.
 Long, long night.
 How about that? Einstein was wrong.
 Approaching the speed of light doesn’t slow down time. Approaching them does.
 Kites, ho!
 Kites, ho!
 If you’re referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin, he did not discover electricity, he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity. He also invented the Franklin stove, bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter. Kites, ho.
 We’re heading out for some kite fighting.
 Oh, yeah. It’s an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport.
 You want to come watch?
 Oh. Football, sure.
 No, no, I’m not, so, great. You’ve got plans doing something you like, I’ve got plans doing something I like, so it’s good.
 Yeah, great.
 Well, this sucks.
 Why wouldn’t Pennyy want her friends to meet me?
 Maybe Koothrappali’s right, maybe I embarrass her.
 Sorry.
 So, Pennyy doesn’t want me around her friends, I embarrass her. What else could it be?
 Oh, how kind of her.
 Hey.
 How was your football party?
 Oh, that’s excellent. It’s a weird figure of speech, isn’t it, we won when you weren’t actually playing. When we watch Star Wars, we don’t say, we defeated the Empire.
 Oh, hey, on a related subject, are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?
 Well, you know, I just noticed I haven’t really met any of them.
 Well, yeah, no, I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. Were they here today?
 Of course not. Why would they be? Why would I ask? Why am I rambling? Why don’t you stop me?
 I wouldn’t be bored. Why would I be bored?
 Pennyy, I like all sorts of people. In fact, some of my best friends aren’t geniuses.
 Okay, some of my Facebook friends aren’t geniuses. My point is, if we’re going to be a couple, I should be friends with your friends.
 Another football game?
 Did not know that.
 Sure, sure, just I don’t know much about football.
 Great.
 Okay, a complete pass. First down, New England. I think I’m starting to get this.
 Focus on the game, not the commercials, Raj.
 There’s no fooling you. Now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?
 Sacks, sacks…
 Huh… Scrimmage…
 Oh.
 Apparently.
 Sheldondon, how do you know this stuff?
 Unbelievable.
 So you could teach me?
 Football. I’m going to Pennyy’s on Saturday to watch a game with her friends and I don’t want to look like an idiot. I want to blend in.
 Come on, Sheldondon, please teach me about football. It’ll be fun.
 Please, I’m asking you as a friend.
 Yes.
 I really appreciate this.
 I’m sorry?
 When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?
 What’s wrong with a football jersey?
 I’s the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs. I can’t believe they had one for dogs.
 Anyway, wish me luck.
 Well, I wouldn’t put it exactly that way.
 Yeah, okay, like you said.
 Good-Bye, Sheldondon.
 Yeah, no, I’m trying to fit in, not get laughed at.
 Go! Go! Go! Go-Go-Go-Go! Yes! Are you people watching this? Is this amazing or what?
 Oh. Did not know that.
 None, why?
 Okay, yeah. I can see the difference.
 That completely was a forward pass, which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time. I can’t believe they’re not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul.
 Pennyy, you know I’m lactose intolerant.
 Mimesis?
 What the hell are you talking about?
 Oh, I guess so.
 I don’t want to fly kites, Sheldondon. We’re watching football here.
 Oh, look at that. The Oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating he’s challenging the ruling on the field. I hope he’s right, ’cause if he’s not, it’ll cost him one of his three time-Outs.
 No, I’ll watch the end of the game. Besides, there’s only three minutes left.
 This is just half? We’ve been here for hours.
 Oh, you’re kidding me.
 Nice meeting all of you.
 We must not be playing it right.
 Oh, gee, Sheldondon, I don’t think we can play on Sunday.
 Because of the reasons that Pennyy will now tell you. Pennyy?
 There you go, she has to pick up her friend Justin at the airport, aAnd I can’t play ’cause I’m going with her, right?
 Wait. What are you talking about?
 Who is this Justin?
 No, you didn’t.
 Hang on. Some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch?
 So by friend, do you mean friend friend, gay friend, or ex boyfriend who you’re now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friend”?
 Oh, a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend’s couch. Yippee.
 Okay, not to be pedantic, but the last I checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out, which I think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked.
 What was your first clue?
 I’m not talking to you like you’re an idiot! I’m saying the whole idea is idiotic!
 You know what? It is your life. If you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch, then fine. Why don’t you just rent some bunk beds and invite The Black Eyed Peas?
 Are you listening to yourself? Do you know how childish you sound right now?
 The two aren’t mutually exclusive!
 He’s drowning us out. He doesn’t like fighting.
 I heard of ’em. Didn’t know they were a band. Sheldondon, she’s gone. You can turn off the blender.
 No, we just had a little spat.
 I don’t get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.
 I don’t want to play a game, Sheldondon.
 An old boyfriend who’s definitely not gay. That’s what a guy likes to hear, definitely.
 And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy!
 What am I supposed to say? Sure, Pennyy, I’m cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment. Well, Leonardard, it doesn’t matter if you’re cool or not because I’m Pennyy and I’m pretty and I can do whatever the hell I want! Oh, I get it! You think you’re doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me! No, no, Leonardard! I’m doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you!
 What?
 Calm down, we’ll make the movie.
 Hey. We’re, uh, going to the movies.
 Hang on. They’re showing a new digital print of Time Bandits, you wouldn’t want to come, would you?
 Just give us a minute.
 So, are we going to talk about last night?
 No.
 Oh, come on. This is stupid.
 No, there’s a difference between being stupid and acting stupid.
 No, there isn’t! They’re synonyms!
 Oh, we need to kill a couple hours till the next showing of Time Bandits.
 Thanks, Stuartrt. Let me ask you something. Do you think it’s okay for Pennyy to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?
 Thank you!
 I am not going to fold.
 Hey.
 Sure.
 What?
 What? Who would tell you something like that? Why would you tell her something like that?
 Okay, yeah, it’s true, but I can live with that stuff. What I can’t live with is you casually informing me that some guy’s going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first!
 Oh, come on. Sheldondon, have you ever once heard me say that I don’t trust Pennyy? Sheldondon? Where did he go?
 Where are you going? You just walk away in the middle of an argument?!
 Why didn’t you say so?
 Well, I can’t read your mind, Pennyy!
 What are you doing? He’s not a lost dog.
 The brake might be imaginary, but that stop sign you just ran wasn’t.
 Eyes on the road. Eyes on the road!
 Hey, Stuartrt, have you seen Sheldondon?
 Thank you.
 I’m not leaving until you talk to me.
 It’s a little hard to explain. He does this thing where he pretends he’s in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we’re in, but he can’t perceive us.
 Yeah, where’s he gonna sleep?
 Why should I let it go? Why don’t you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep? Oh, for God’s sakes. So, you have childhood issues, we all have childhood issues, at some point, you just need to grow up and get past them. 
 Always is a long time. Sure. Always.
 Oh, come on, he’s just going to play with it twice, and then it’ll end up in his closet with all the other junk.
 So what did Justin say when you told him he couldn’t sleep on your couch?
 Uh, t-minus five hours, 37 minutes to onset of meteor shower.
 Uh, we have a signal, but there’s no frame lock.
 Oh, hey. Dune.
 Too bad Sheldondon couldn’t come with us.
 I wish Pennyy didn’t have to work, she loves camping.
 Come on, you guys can’t be that hard up.
 Of course, they did. That’s what grandmothers do.
 Mmmm, not bad.
 Stars are pretty, aren’t they?
 I can feel it. I can feel the earth moving. It’s moving too fast. Raj, slow it down.
 Better. Thanks.
 What’s so funny?
 I hate my name. It has nerd in it. Len nerd.
 You know what’s a cool name? Angelo. That has angel and jell-o in it.
 People could call me Angie. Yo, Angie, how’s it goin’?
 No. That was the last pudding cup.
 That’s what he used to eat his pudding, remember?
 The only thing in here are blue ice packs.
 Oh, god, I am so hungry.
 Okay.
 Will you shut up? We’re all hungry.
 What kind of score are we looking at?
 All right, everyone grab flashlights.
 Quick, get forks.
 I feel like we’re forgetting something important.
 Yes!
 He struck out.
 With Pennyy and me, it took two years. Now that I think about it, that was three dates.
 No, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open.
 The cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates.
 Never mind, what’s your announcement?
 Are you really going to be on NPR?
 Very cool, congratulations.
 You know, when Sheldondon gives you homework, you don’t have to do it.
 Hey.
 You’d have a better shot with the three-breasted Martian hooker from Total Recall.
 Excuse me, I’m sitting here.
 Again, I’m right here.
 I am here, right? You see me.
 How ya doin’, buddy?
 Come on, it wasn’t that bad.
 Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you.
 Raj.
 I fell on the floor. All right, he got you, you can get him back.
 Are you really admitting defeat?
 Good.
 What if you could make Kripke look even sillier than he made you look?
 You’re not helping.
 Sheldondon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke, like, uh, like, how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane.
 No, no.
 Okay, uh, that’s the spirit, but, um, let’s dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance.
 Let’s keep thinking.
 This is brilliant, Sheldondon. How are we going to deploy it in Kripke’s office?
 Let me guess, motion sensors?
 I gotta say, I am really impressed. This is truly the Sheldondon Cooper way to get even. 
 Who is that with him?
 And the board of directors. Abort! Abort!
 At least they don’t know it was you.
 I think it upsets Sheldondon when you play with the food.
 It upsets Sheldondon when you play with the Sheldondon.
 Yeah. Hey.
 Sure. The more, the merrier.
 Sheldondon…
 Relax, it’ll be fine, sit down, you guys.
 NO!
 That’s where Sheldondon sits.
 I am. Are you interested in physics?
 Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. Right now, we’re testing the phase shift due to an electric potential.
 Yes, I am. You want to see a simulation on my laptop?
 Hey, look, it’s Howardrd and his girlfriend Bernadetteadette.
 Yeah, no, I got it.
 Ah, terrific. We’re getting the electron accelerator set up. We should be ready to go day after tomorrow.
 You’re welcome to come.
 Excuse me?
 Yeah? So?
 What are you talking about?
 Has it ever worked?
 Howardrd, relax, I’m not interested in your girlfriend.
 I believe you.
 What did I do now?
 What?
 You do have a problem with her hanging out with me.
 What was I supposed to tell her?
 And what would that be?
 You told her my experiment was stupid?
 Should I, um, leave you two alone?
 Okay, good, ’cause I wasn’t really gonna go.
 We’re shocked.
 Or loud noises, clowns and nuns.
 He had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck in a sweater.
 I don’t know. Maybe because I’m crazy?
 It’s up to you. He didn’t call your experiment stupid.
 Tushy face, that is going on Twitter right now.
 I’m glad you enjoyed it. Most people aren’t that interested in what I do.
 Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la.
 When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun.
 Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la.
 We didn’t have a tree when I was growing up.
 Mmm, in my family, holidays weren’t so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society.
 Mmm, in a way. We presented papers, and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other.
 Here we go.
 Merry Newton-mas, everyone.
 No, he doesn’t.
 Yeah, you got me. I’m a Leibniz man.
 Tomorrow.
 Um, tomorrow?
 Well, I just, I thought…
 You are, it’s just…
 I know. And those specials, they change every day.
 Okay, sorry.
 Um…
 Um…
 Um…
 I drove, Mother. I’m driving now.
 Wait, wait, wait. When did you send my mom notes on a paper?
 Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?
 No, I heard that.
 I just don’t understand why he knows more about your life than I do.
 Fine, Mom. How are you?
 Now I’m less fine.
 No. Sheldondon, why didn’t you tell me?
 You must be very happy.
 Not the time, Sheldondon.
 I don’t know what you’re talking about.
 All right. He “has” a “girlfriend.”
 Oh, glad you’re here, uh, sit down, I’ll get you a plate. Mom, you remember Pennyy.
 What?
 No!
 When did this happen?
 Mitzy’s dead?
 I don’t believe this. Why am I the last to know?
 You’re right. I’m-I’m-I’m-I’m sorry, I’m way out of line!
 What is it?
 I don’t want tea.
 Then why are you telling me?
 That’s a lousy conversation starter.
 What do you want, Sheldondon?
 I want that too. Why are you here?
 Thank you, that’s very comforting.
 It’s not?
 You’re right, I do feel better.
 You’re my surrogate family?
 What the hell is going on?
 Are you guys drunk?
 How come you didn’t tell me that you and Father were getting a divorce? How come you didn’t tell me you had surgery? How come you didn’t tell me my dog died?
 I do.
 Once again, I’m driving. I’m right here.
 Wait a minute, what are you talking about? What inappropriate behaviour?
 What the hell, agreed.
 Mother, remember when I was complaining that you don’t communicate with me enough?
 I’m over it.
 Look at us. Getting ready for a double date with actual women who publicly acknowledge they’re our girlfriends.
 Howardrd, artificial women are your department. You want to take this?
 What are you trying to tell me, Howardrd?
 Don’t worry. We’re planning to have sex right on the salad bar.
 Got it.
 Uh, sorry, Raj. Howardrd and I are going out to dinner with Pennyy and Bernadetteadette.
 How did we get actual women?
 I hope you’re hungry, Bernadetteadette, we’re going to a terrific restaurant.
 Great. How come?
 Of course, I would never make fun of you.
 Seriously? You’re getting career advice from a psychic?
 Oh, gee, why didn’t you say so? They don’t let just anyone have a Web site.
 You’re surprised? Your psychic didn’t tell you I was going to be a jerk?
 Come on, Pennyy.
 I’m sorry, but facts are facts.
 No, if it’s not a fact, it’s not a fact.
 You’re welcome. How’s your fish?
 Yeah, sure.
 Come on, Howardrd, Bernadetteadette, you’re both scientists. Help me out here.
 Maybe we should just stop talking about this.
 You know, the best thing about being in a committed, monogamous, mutually supportive relationship is that even if you have different ideas, you can have a spirited debate, yet still care for, even make love with…  Want your fish? I knew you were going to do that. Doesn’t make me psychic! Attaboy, Leonardard, make it worse. 
 What’s going on?
 Laser.
 What the hell is eighth base?
 Oh, couldn’t be better.
 It’s not just Cylons. Superman’s next.
 How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?
 And that didn’t bother you?
 What am I supposed to do, pretend I believe something I don’t whenever I’m with Pennyy?
 Do me a favour, lean over, put your head right here.
 What’s your point? In order to keep having a sexual relationship with Pennyy, I have to give up everything I believe in, my intellectual integrity, the very nature of who I am? I can’t do that, Howardrd.
 What is that?
 Hey. Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh? Not only is it courteous, it’s safety smart. Every year, 15,000 fires are caused by accidental dryer lint ignition. Now you’re supposed to say, wow, what an interesting fact. Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy. I could never be mad at you.
 No, I’m sorry. I really am. It’s not right to mock what a person believes in.
 Would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?
 Okay, let’s go see your psychic.
 Well, yeah, one of us has to keep an open mind.
 No, not at all. Let me help you with this stuff.
 Great.
 I know, and pyramid power and healing crystals.
 Really, that’s the line? Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?
 So what? It’s the same food.
 It’s obviously a typo.
 You know what? Let’s just get a pizza.
 And why is that?
 What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?
 What the…?
 So are our laptops.
 We like games.
 What about me?
 Would I be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him?
 How is that going to help them?
 What are we supposed to do now?
 Does that mean you’ve ruled me out as a suspect?
 Hey, there’s no reason for you to be scared.
 Hand me the bat.
 We’re fine, Sheldondon.
 Mm-hmm.
 Yes, we are. And we’re about to go to bed.
 What do you want?
 But you don’t like other people.
 It’s getting scary here, too.
 Did we win? Can we go to bed?
 He’s right, Pennyy. It’s all there.
 Great. Good night.
 4am.
 Just keep walking. 
 Who is it?
 I’ll send them a basket of muffins.
 Where did you get all this stuff?
 He just gave it to you?
 Sorry, let me help you.
 God, Sheldondon. What the hell are you doing out there?
 It was us. We knocked over a lamp.
 We were going to have…
 What are you doing? Use the door.
 Great, you do that.
 I’m lactose intolerant.
 Sorry about that.
 Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified.
 Don’t you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?
 Oh, no, he’s going to telecommute. Everybody’s really excited about it.
 Any place specific or just the Bozeman, Montana Loony Bin?
 They call themselves Bozites?
 Pennyy, I told you if you don’t put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment.
 Mmm, he’s either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually, or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after Peter Pan cut it off.
 Aye, aye, Captain.
 Maybe you need a fresh start.
 Intellectually about 30 hours. Emotionally about 29 years.
 No, I think it’s a firmware problem.
 I think Pennyy likes to skate. The four of us could double.
 Yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant.
 I haven’t seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third Matrix movie.
 Here, you want my peas?
 So roller skating, should we all grab a bite to eat first?
 Great. Your mom’s not coming, right?
 You had some nice moves out there, Howardrd.
 Yeah. Did you notice all the people looking at us?
 Sorry. I’m moving a little slow. I think I bruised my coccyx.
 Don’t tell Koothrappali. After you.
 Oh, my God! Are you… 
 Are you okay?
 Don’t bark at me. I fell, too.
 No, that’s a crazy thing.
 That was amazing how you handled him.
 It’s not me, it’s my new ringtone. The Joker from Batman.
 Me, too, but I paid three bucks for it.
 Hello. Yeah, I’m Leonardard Hofstadter. Yeah, yeah, he’s my roommate. Oh, God, is he okay? Yeah, alright, alright, I’ll be right there.
 Sheldondon’s escaped and is terrorizing the village.
 Hi. I’m Dr. Hofstadter. Where is he?
 Thanks for not calling the cops.
 Yeah, well, he’s extra special. Hey, Sheldonly. What you doing?
 Sure, sure. How did you get into this place?
 No, I don’t think so. We need to go home now.
 If you don’t come out of there, I’m going to have to drag you out.
 For God’s sakes. Sheldondon, come here!
 What! What, what, what?
 What?
 And you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?
 Because we didn’t want to be disturbed.
 Really? You figured out the graphene problem?
 What are you talking about?
 Yeah, I’m going to need a little more.
 Keep going.
 So, you’re going to go work at the patent office?
 Sounds like a great plan.
 Okay, well, thanks for sharing with us. Good night.
 Told you.
 Hang on. Black beans, not pinto beans?
 Double guacamole?
 No cilantro?
 Lettuce shredded, not chopped?
 You understand why I’m doing this to you?
 That’ll be all. That was fun.
 I heard about this professor at MIT who melted down, bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer.
 Only to shampoo Professor Chambourg’s shih tzu.
 Yeah, that’s the only thing wrong with that plan.
 Sheldondon took our order.
 Well, honey, not to complain, but we were starting to think you didn’t either.
 Sheldondon, come here.
 Who’s miserable and alone?
 Oh. I used to be like that. Then I got a girlfriend.
 Hey, what are you and Bernadetteadette doing for your first Valentine’s Day?
 Okay, so to sum up: one giant marble horse, one asinine comment, one lonely man and his chicken. And let’s see, who’s left? Oh, that’s right. My plans. Isn’t anyone going to ask?
 That’s not what I was going to tell you.
 Guess who the university is sending to Switzerland to attend a conference and see the CERN supercollider on February 14?
 Actually, Professor Norton can’t make it. He threw his back out rock climbing.
 In any case, they’re asking me to fill in for him.
 Switzerland. And I get to bring a guest!
 I am taking Pennyy.
 Sheldondon, you got a minute?
 Sheldondon, I’m not taking you to Switzerland.
 Pennyy.
 Yes, but it’ll be Valentine’s Day. We can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped Alps.
 I’m sorry, Sheldondon.
 Yeah, well, I’ve been dreaming about spending Valentine’s Day with a girl since I was six.
 Just a minute. This tray contains clues as to what you and I are going to be doing on Valentine’s Day.
 No. But it does involve air travel. Okay, um, let me slice this Swiss cheese with my Swiss army knife, and then you can wash it down with a cup of Swiss Miss instant cocoa.
 Uh-huh.
 How does that involve air travel?
 No.
 We’re going to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider! And ski. We’ll also go skiing.
 Well, you’ll ski, I’ll fall, but, yeah, we will be in Switzerland for Valentine’s Day.
 Sheldondon, we’ve been through this. I’m taking Pennyy.
 Not the roommate agreement.
 Oh, for God’s sakes.
 Yeah. We also put in what happens if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant, or if one of us gets superpowers, or if one of us is bitten by a zombie.
 Sheldondon, do you really expect to enforce this?
 No.
 Look, Sheldondon, I know it’s in the agreement, and if you turn into a zombie, I promise I will not kill you. In fact, I’ll even let you eat my brains. But I am taking Pennyy to Switzerland.
 It is.
 What do you think?
 Got a bit of traffic this morning, huh? Think it’s gonna rain? Instead of underpants, I covered my crotch with potato salad this morning. Thoughts? Okay, I know what’ll cheer you up, let’s play one of your driving games.
 You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas?
 Come on, Sheldondon. Can’t you at least try to understand how much this means to me?
 Rupert Murdoch?
 You seen Sheldondon?
 Yeah. He thinks I betrayed him. I mean, come on, what would you guys do if you were me?
 Seriously?
 Uh, let’s see. Yup, 30 pieces of silverware.
 What’s going on?
 You made Frodo pancakes?
 Why are you doing this?
 Thanks. It’s good.
 You hate Babylon 5.
 Okay, great. Still not taking you to Switzerland.
 Sheldondon, I need to talk to you.
 Some what?
 You’re not going to Switzerland!
 She told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.
 Well, forget it. I was the one who was invited, I get to decide who goes with me, and it’s Pennyy, not you!
 I don’t need to see your presentation. This discussion is over!
 Sheldondon, at this point, I would go by myself before I would take you.
 Yeah, really.
 I’m sorry you feel that way.
 Why don’t you enlighten me?
 Just think, this time tomorrow we’ll be in Geneva, Switzerland for our first Valentine’s Day.
 Thermal? ‘Cause it’s gonna be cold.
 Oh!
 Gesundheit. Or as they say in Switzerland, gesundheit. You getting a cold?
 Do you want an allergy pill? ‘Cause I have ’em all. Prescription, nonprescription, foreign, domestic, experimental.
 Not really, I’m just an enthusiast.
 Pennyy? You okay?
 What’s going on?
 Well, our plane leaves at 9 a.m. Do you think you’ll feel better by then?
 Hey, Sheldondon? Listen, Pennyy is pretty sick and she’s not going to be able to go to Switzerland. So if you’re still interested, you’re welcome to come. 
 Yeah, I forgot about all this.
 Will you please turn your shirt off?
 Hey, Stuartrt, what’s going on?
 Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease.
 I can’t decide whether I want Stan Lee to autograph my Journey into Mystery 83, first appearance of Thor or my Fantastic Four number five, first appearance of Dr. Doom. Alex, I’m going to go with what is… you’re a dumbass?
 He does. And in the kitchen. And in the car. And in his pocket.
 Hey. Guess who’s going to be at the comic bookstore on Thursday?
 Stan Lee.
 No, no, Stan Lee.
 You have no idea who he is, do you?
 Good, good, so, who’s Stan Lee?
 Nope.
 No.
 That’s Bruce Lee.
 It’s not that big a deal. You just go down to the court on Thursday and you pay the fine.
 Oh, that’s right. Thursday is Stan Lee Day.
 Whoa! What do you mean all?
 Yeah, okay. No.
 That’s what I’m saying.
 Oh, come on, why would you do that?
 Hey.
 Sheldondon’s in jail?
 For what?
 So tell him to apologize.
 Oh, no, that’s terrible. Ooh, the line’s moving. Got to go. Bye.
 Look at that. To my friend, Leonardard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!
 Oh, hey, buddy. How’d it go?
 Yeah, but we all want to hear it from you.
 Okay, that’s enough, Howardrd. The poor guy’s had a tough time. He had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit.
 Except for Raj.
 Hey, where’ve you been?
 Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?
 One more floor, and I’d be the pulled muscle.
 Uh, well, we didn’t actually get Chinese food.
 Don’t panic, this is better.
 We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant when we thought we saw Adam West, so we followed him.
 Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff.
 We didn’t even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here.
 No. But there is an original final draft Ghostbusters script with actual slime stains! Oh, you’re right, it’s Ghostbusters 2. Never mind.
 Here’s Spock’s head with no body. Here’s Mr. T’s body with no head. Oh, yeah, here’s Spock’s body with Mr. T’s head. I pity the fool who’s illogical.
 Okay, bye.
 Ooh, look, an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots.
 What?
 Oh.
 And in the darkness bind them.
 Seedy underbelly?
 He’s not saying it’s a magic ring. You’re not, are you?
 No, it is not yours. We all went in on the box together.
 How is this maritime salvage?
 Guys, it’s stolen. It should go back to Peter Jackson. He made the movies, it belongs to him.
 We are not blackmailing Peter J… All right, where’s the ring?
 What are you doing?
 Give me that.
 You always get your way.
 Yeah, it’s delicious, the sarcasm’s a little stale, though. Hey, how about this? Until we figure out what to do with the ring, Pennyy holds on to it.
 This ring.
 Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?
 It’s a prop from a movie, and we’re kind of fighting over it.
 How am I looking now?
 What was that?
 That’s my girl.
 No.
 We’re not giving him two Jet Skis.
 No Jet Skis.
 You know what? I am ending this. Pennyy didn’t want to hold the ring anymore. She gave it to me, I have it. I’m sending it back. Where’s the ring?
 Give me that.
 Okay, now, this is ridiculous!
 I’m not letting go, you let go.
 Fine. But can’t we go home and start this?
 All right, it starts now.
 And it wasn’t when we were driving like this?
 You want to talk about endless patience? Pennyy made me watch all five seasons of Sex and the City.
 Oh, crap!
 Door. 
 Last one holding the ring decides its fate. I know, it sounds silly.
 Thank you.
 I’m out.
 It’s in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from.
 Peter Jackson’s office in New Zealand. It wasn’t ours.
 I came in here, you guys were all sleeping. The ring was on the floor. No one was touching it.
 There wasn’t ever going to be a winner. There was going to be a selfish, petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend. Is that really what you guys want? ‘Cause if it is, fine, I don’t want anything to do with you. And I don’t know what happened in that bathroom, but I am not cleaning it up! My precious.
 NEVER!
It's mine!
 Hey, Sheldondon, I was up in the administration office, and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year’s Chancellor’s Award for Science.
 Oh, I’m so glad you asked it like that. You.
 You won.
 Hey, you didn’t want a Slurpee at 7-Eleven, you don’t get glasses.
 What?
 What, to you, is a large crowd?
 Sheldondon, you’re being ridiculous.
 Sheldondon? Sheldondon, are you okay?
 Sit down, we want to talk to you.
 We think we can help you with your stage fright.
 We can help you. We can be your team. Like, uh, Professor Xavier and his X-Men.
 Yeah, we watched it last week. You said you liked it.
 I thought I could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety.
 My mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist, and I’ve been in therapy ever since she accused me of breast-feeding co-dependently.
 So, Sheldondon, how you doing?
 I’m sorry, I’ll start again.
 Um, I don’t know, maybe.
 How did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale?
 Why don’t we just talk?
 Why don’t I just start? Sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if, on a subconscious level, they don’t feel they deserve them. Do you think maybe that’s what’s happening here?
 But it could be part of your problem. Let me give you an example. When I was eight, I won a ribbon at the science fair for my project, “Do Lima Beans Grow Better to Classical Music.” But my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother’s earlier “Do Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock ‘n’ Roll.” I felt so guilty, I gave the ribbon back.
 Terrible. I worked really hard on that project. I stayed up all night singing the clown’s aria from Pagliacci to a lima bean sprout.
 It wasn’t my fault. I had never seen my brother’s project. And my mother could’ve told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone.
 Damn right, I’m angry with my mother. For God’s sake, I was eight years old. She humiliated me. That’s when the bed-wetting started again.
 For what?
 Wait, that’s it? I thought we had a whole hour!
 Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dr. Leonardard Hofstadter, and it is my very great honour to introduce the winner of this year’s Chancellor’s award for Science and my good friend, Dr. Sheldondon Cooper. But before I do, I’d like to share with you a letter from Sheldondon’s mother, who couldn’t be here tonight. Isn’t that nice? His mother sent him a letter. She’s proud of him. I wonder what that feels like. Dear Sheldonly. That’s what she calls him. Sheldonly, it’s a pet name. You know what my mother’s pet name for me is? Leonardard. But I digress. Dear Sheldonly. I am so proud of… 
 First of all, the projects were totally different. I was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans and makes them grow, but my mother didn’t hear me. If you’d like to look at the relationship between nurturing and growth, I’d like to point out that my brother is eight inches taller than me.
 Oh, right. Ladies and gentlemen, our guest of honour, Dr. Sheldondon Cooper.
 You might want to check YouTube.
 It’s already loaded. Just hit play.
 Uh-uh, give it a minute.
 No, no, I’m good. If my P.E. teachers had told me this is what I was training for, I would have tried a lot harder.
 Did you just quote Star Wars?
 Oh, my God. I’m lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote Yoda. I love you, Pennyy.
 You’re welcome. I just wanted to put that out there.
 Good. Glad is good.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, probably.
 Good night.
 Seriously? You have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?
 I honestly don’t care.
 What do you want from me? I just don’t give a rat’s ass.
 Can we please talk about something else? Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?
 No, there was no spat.
 I don’t want to talk about it.
 What? No.
 No.
 No.
 I’m walking away from you now.
 Oh, hey.
 You don’t have to come if you don’t want to.
 Chilli cheese fry?
 Really? You love them?
 No reason. I’m just glad to hear you’re comfortable saying you love something.
 Get into what? Why wouldn’t you love the chilli cheese fries? They’ve been in your life a long time. They make you happy. They deserve to know.
 Okay, well, now you’ve had some time to think about it. So, what do you want to say?
 How can you not be sure?
 No, the place to have the conversation was in bed after I said, I love you, and you said, Thank you, good night.
 I am not pushing anything.
 What? No, it’s okay. We don’t have to talk ’cause there’s nothing to talk about. Everything’s good.
 All right, maybe I overreacted. So we’re in two different places emotionally. So what? And maybe I’m a little ahead of you. That’s fine. You know. In fact, it makes sense, ’cause let’s face it, I’ve been in this relationship two years longer than you.
 Really? I wouldn’t know what that’s like.
 Yeah, I do.
 Yes, that’s what I’m telling you. We are good. We are great.
 Wesley Crusher was Wil Wheaton’s character on Star Trek.
 This is fun, huh?
 It’s good that we got out and did something physical.
 Gets us out of our heads. You get in your head, you start to overthink, overanalyze, obsess, you worry. That’s not what we’re doing tonight. Tonight we’re just throwing a ball at some pins.
 Mm-hmm, and someday, we don’t know when, maybe you’ll love me back. Ooh, I’m up.
 Sheldon-don! Sheldon-don! Sheldon-don! Sheldon-don!
 The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball!
 Pennyy, you’re up.
 We really need a strike here.
 So just take your time and concentrate.
 I’m not pressuring you.
 Okay, I’m sorry. I’ll shut up.
 Fine. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.
 No, let her go.
 I’m pretty sure it’s already over.
 Hey, where you been?
 No, no, it’s fine. I don’t care. I’m over it.
 Sheldondon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you’re hungry.
 Okay.
 I don’t know. Why?
 Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldondon?
 So, you guys want to do something tonight?
 What about you, Raj?
 I never stopped hanging out with you.
 You know what? I’ll just spend the evening alone.
 Since when do you take after-dinner walks?
 Yeah?
 Where you going with this, Raj?
 So, go.
 And you think my presence will help with that?
 I’m not going out tonight, Raj.
 Very much.
 Don’t worry. You’ll meet a girl someday.
 Yes, you will, and she’ll be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman.
 I do, and you’ll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she’ll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces.
 I’m pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys.
 Hey, where you been?
 For an hour and a half?
 How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.
 What the hell was that about?
 Oh, we really need to get you a girl.
 Oh, just come in!
 What do you want, Sheldondon?
 Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.
 What do you want?
 I’m in bed!
 Sheldondon!
 Okay, when you say seeing Pennyy, what exactly does that mean?
 Fine. Why did you have dinner with Pennyy?
 Then why did you have Chinese food with us?
 Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?
 Sheldondon, I don’t care if you want to be friends with Pennyy.
 Yes.
 I guess not.
 D-don’t be silly. We’re neighbours, we’re going to run into each other, may as well get used to it.
 You used to it yet?
 Me neither. Oh, Sheldondon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it’s fine.
 His mother?
 I was going to do that.
 No, I don’t want to do it. You can do it.
 I just took him for shoes.
 Fine. I’ll take him for shoes next Saturday.
 You’re taking him to Disneyland?
 All right. But let me know if you’re going to stuff him with junk food. I don’t want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.
 All I’m saying is give me a heads-up.
 And don’t let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. He’ll say he can handle it, but I promise you’ll end up with churro puke on your shoes.
 Yeah, don’t let Goofy near him. He’ll have nightmares and I’ll have to deal with it.
 Wish I knew. He’s fine with Pluto.
 It’s ten o’clock, where have you been?
 I was going to see that with him.
 And I have food here. You said you were going to call.
 We’re not fighting.
 Aren’t you going to thank Pennyy for taking you to Disneyland?
 Want a cup of coffee?
 Come on. It’s just a cup of coffee.
 What am I smelling?
 Yeah. Shame he has to wake up.
 Smother Sheldondon in his sleep? Wouldn’t that be wrong?
 Oh. Sure. Absolutely.
 Here’s an idea. I’m just throwing it out there, friends who have sex.
 Kidding. Just a couple of friends goofin’ around.
 Yeah, it’s just one sneeze. You’re on your own.
 When you say non-related female, you still mean human, right?
 Why didn’t you tell me you knew Elizabeth Plimpton? I am a huge fan of hers!
 Okay, fine. Where is she going to sleep?
 Thank you. Why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?
 I can’t believe he’s friends with Elizabeth Plimpton.
 She’s here, she’s here. How do I look? Do I look smart?
 Oh, I have so many things to tell your biographer.
 Hi-lo. Oops. I started to say hi, and then I switched to hello in the middle. It came out hi-lo. Duh. Uh, it’s nice to meet you. I’ve read both your books and most of your papers. I’m Leonardard, I live here, you’re brilliant.
 Are you hungry, thirsty? Can I offer you anything?
 Look, it’s you.
 Well, who wants to stay in a hotel? With windows that don’t open, those crazy card-shaped keys.
 Well, I understand, too.
 Oh. I think any university would want you. Except, of course, any university that had already had you. Because they would’ve already wanted you before they, you know, got you.
 Uh, sleep night. I mean, obviously, good night. I started to say sleep tight, then I changed my mind in the middle. I swear to God, I’m smart.
 Yes?
 Is everything all right?
 Me neither. Oh, look what I’m reading. It’s you.
 I did, but it’s been a while, and I wanted to sound smart over breakfast.
 Oh, good. Wasn’t sure it was coming across.
 Uh, six.
 Sure.
 Really? Uh, sure doesn’t read that way.
 Wow. You really make science come alive.
 Morning, Sheldondon.
 How do you take your coffee?
 Okeydoke.
 Something his mother taught him.
 Oh, yeah, sure, let me just put this in a travel mug.
 Okay, well, I guess I should get dressed so I can take everyone to work. You and Sheldondon and Sheldondon’s friend, Dr. Plimpton, who you just met. It’ll be fun. Like a clown car.
 Hmm? Yeah? What? Huh?
 What, uh, you and me? Yeah, we did. Not too long ago. How are you doing with it?
 I, um, I don’t follow.
 Well, now…
 Well…
 Come on. It wasn’t my fault.
 Pennyy, I can still drive you.
 I didn’t betray Pennyy.
 How am I betraying you?
 Yeah, I guess I did.
 You still have a cold?
 Are you having trouble sleeping? ‘Cause, boy, I was up all night.
 No, but I was awake all night.
 No, that’s okay. It was something else keeping me up last night. And again this morning. And, I didn’t mind. I was up last night. I was up this morning. I didn’t mind. Those are your clues.
 No.
 No.
 Okay, I’ll give you one more clue. It involved another person.
 Hey, you.
 Boy, I’m kind of tuckered out. How are you feeling, Elizabeth?
 Sure. Black, right?
 Coming right up.
 Hey, who’s ready for Halo?
 I don’t understand.
 Elizabeth? What’s going on?
 Is she suggesting what I think she’s suggesting?
 We’ll all be naked in front of each other.
 I thought we had something special.
 Hey.
 Thanks. It’s really hard to find these in his size. So, listen. I’ve been meaning to talk to you about the other morning.
 Yeah, I wanted to explain.
 I don’t?
 So you’re not judging me?
 Nevertheless, I’d like to get one on the record so you can understand why I did what I did.
 She let me.
 It’s just two degrees, Sheldondon. I just want to turn up the thermostat two degrees!
 Yes, if we lived in a teakettle.
 Aw, screw the roommate agreement!
 You know what, go to Hell and set their thermostat.
 Leonardard.
 Can I sleep on your couch tonight?
 You heard that, huh?
 So you agree, he’s nuts.
 Believe it or not, he was worse when I met him.
 You are so naive. Just like I was seven years ago.  I’d just started at the university.
 Excuse me, I’m looking for Sheldondon Cooper’s apartment.
 Yeah.
 What?
 That should have been my first clue.
 For all I knew, he was the crazy one. He had this really deranged look.
 Sure, it makes sense now. Anyway, I went upstairs and knocked on the door.
 Dr. Cooper?
 In retrospect, that was clue number two.
 I’m Leonardard Hofstadter. I called you about the apartment. You said…
 What?
 Uh, radon?
 Telling you? Telling you.
 Oh, uh, well, that’s tricky. Um, well, uh, Original Series over Next Generation, but Picard over Kirk.
 Oh, this is pretty nice. Uh, the bedrooms are back there?
 I don’t understand, their, their existence is conditional?
 There’s three?
 Okay.
 What’s the difference?
 Can you do that?
 Uh, yeah, experimental physics.
 What is that?
 Yes.
 A car, yeah.
 Well, can’t you drive?
 Okay, I suppose I could drive you. Well that’s a point in my favour, right?
 Come on, I just asked.
 Uh, I’m gonna go with preserving the knowledge.
 Oh, good. I passed the barriers.
 Uh, I guess.
 When I have to.
 I, I’m sorry, uh, in the morning. Around eight.
 Fine. I’ll take it.
 Is this it?
 So where do you sleep?
 If people don’t go in there, and you’re people, and… You are people, aren’t you? Making a joke.
 On occasion.
 No, I didn’t just move in. First we had to iron out a few details. 
 Does that really need to be in the agreement?
 We have a flag?
 Okay.
 It was the best apartment I’d seen, the rent was very reasonable and after you’ve passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way.
 Okay, how about this? Let me tell you about the first time I brought a girl over. (Flashback to Leonardard’s bedroom.)
 Shh. Just pretend we’re not here.
 I’m sure he’ll go away.
 What do you want? I didn’t say come in!
 I didn’t even know her 12 hours ago.
 But, Joyce, come on.
 Do I get some sympathy now?
 Actually, I couldn’t get too mad at him about Joyce Kim.
 Well, I was doing some government research at the time, you know, military, rocket fuel. It’s kind of secret.
 As it turns out, she was a North Korean spy. Luckily, Sheldondon drove her out before I revealed anything important. Which I’m not saying I would have.
 That was part of it. The other part is what happened with the elevator.
 It was, but one night, Sheldondon came home from work… (Flashback, the apartment. The settee has now appeared. Leonardard, Howardrd and Raj are playing a video game.)
 Hey, Sheldondon. This is Howardrd and Raj. They work at the university, too.
 Yeah, not a good idea.
 Oh, well, there were some people on the first floor moving out, and they sold it to me for a hundred dollars. Howardrd and Raj helped me bring it up.
 They’re lawn chairs. And there was no place for company.
 According to the roommate agreement, I’m entitled to allocate 50% of the cubic footage of the common areas.
 I did notify you.
 What am I doing in your spam folder?
 I’m getting to it. (Back to flashback.)
 Ooh, it’s time for Babylon 5!
 Why not?
 I like it.
 There you go– three against one.
 But I said no to that.
 We can fix that. Let’s leave.
 Hey, do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not?
 That your dad?
 Oh, man. Is that a two-stage rocket?
 Oh, this just might be your lucky day.
 Well, it turns out I had a little rocket fuel in the apartment.
 Mm, Joyce Kim was kind of curious about what I did for a living, and I was going to kind of show it to her. It’s not important. The point is, the guys and I went back to the apartment.
 Yeah, we’re really close. Uh, uh, we’re at the apartment. (Flashback.)
 The trick is to mix it into Tovex in order to create a combustible gel that will generate over 8,000 kilonewtons of thrust.
 Excuse me, but I’ve been working on this a long time. Trust me, it’ll work.
 There’s no mistake.
 Well, I’ve adjusted the formula.
 Okay, I’ve had it with you. You might be an expert on theoretical physics and science-fiction programs and where to sit on a freaking couch, but this is applied physics. And when it comes to applied physic… uh-oh.
 A bad thing. A very bad thing. Get the door. Get the door! Get the door! Get the door! Get the door!
 Oh. Right.
 What’d you do that for? I had plenty of time. (Elevator explodes.)
 Not only did Sheldondon save my life, he didn’t rat me out to the landlord. Or the police. Or Homeland Security.
 So I did something stupid. I’m sure you did stupid things when you were younger. What were you doing seven years ago?
 Hey.
 Oh, uh, clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi. Men can get those. Anyway, I may owe you an apology.
 I did agree to the thermostat setting, and I shouldn’t have tried to change it.
 Okay, I’m sorry.
 So, we’re good?
 Never mind. Okay if I watch some TV?
 You’re not even watching!
 Oh, so the dialogue offends you?
 You’re insane, you know that?!
 Okay, we’ve got power to the laser.
 What for? It’s not going to rain.
 Howardrd, do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser? We need it locked onto the Sea of Tranquility.
 Relax, it’s just a dirty sock.
 Sheldondon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks.
 Hey, you know who’d really dig seeing this experiment? Pennyy.
 I don’t know, it’s still a little weird since, you know…
 She didn’t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.
 Screw you guys. I’m gonna go see if she’s home.
 We’re up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.
 It’s pretty cool. We’ve got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything. I thought you might want to see it.
 Oh, sorry, I didn’t know you were busy. Maybe another time.
 Okay, well, yeah, come on up. So, how’d you two guys meet?
 Your company?
 So, menus.
 Let me explain what we’re doing here. Um, in 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we’re going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier.
 The laser?
 Uh, that’s a great question, Zack.
 Don’t worry about the moon. We, we set our laser to stun.
 Now, we’ll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won’t be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye.
 Right. Uh yeah, funny. Uh, that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer. Raj, get them some glasses.
 2.5 seconds for the light to return. That’s the moon! We hit the moon!
 Yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents. The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane.
 No, thanks.
 Have they found a match for you?
 Why not?
 I’ll help you.
 Coming!
 Are you drunk?
 How did I ruin him?
 Come on, he wasn’t that stupid.
 Okay, yeah, he’s stupid.
 How is that my fault?
 Where are we going?
 Why? I mean, okay.
 How many times have I asked you not to do that?
 Where’s Pennyy?
 I wonder why she didn’t say good-bye.
 I know. I just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective.
 Oh, hey.
 Okay, I’ll walk down with you. So, last night was fun, huh?
 Bummer. Anyway, I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie.
 Doesn’t have to be tonight. I’m free pretty much always.
 When you say mistake, do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?
 No, it’s pretty well imprinted on my brain. Especially the whole rodeo thing.
 So, that’s it? Wham, bam, thank you, Leonardard?
 How am I supposed to let it go? You used me for sex! Morning, Mrs. Gunderson.
 Great. Maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do?
 I don’t want to talk about it.
 If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. (Knocks on door) I can’t do it.
 Oh, hi. Hey. Hi, Leslie.
 Uh, I know! It’s been a while!
 Right. Right. So how you doing?
 Uh, not bad. You remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn’t mean anything, it was just for fun?
 Uh, do you, uh, want to do that again?
 She didn’t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.
 Um, anyway, apparently, it’s okay to go back to people you’re no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them.
 So, what do you say?
 She’s not coming back.
 Thirty feet.
 I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!
 Come on. We’re gonna have sex, and it’s not gonna mean a thing!
 I’m really starting to think there’s a double standard here.
