 So you see, what you're eating is not technically yoghurt, because it doesn't have enough live acidophilus cultures. It's really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness.
 It's also not pink and has no berries.
 What was your question again?
 Oh, right, no, I'm lactose intolerant.
 So, gas.
 Well, good night.
 There was a draft.
 Why don't we just go into your….
 No, no, I didn't mean to go into your apartment to… go fast.
 Yeah, okay, sure, no problem, why don't we just figure out where we're going, and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time. Solve for R.
 That might work too.
 Goodnight. 
 Bite me. Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?
 What are you talking about, the date went fine.
 Okay, so, she said she wants to slow things down. It's like saying “I'm really enjoying this meal, I'm going to slow down and savour it.”
 I'm not the fish.
 Well, we sort of decided to wing it.
 Okay, alright, let's assume your hypothesis. We went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed, where could I have possibly gone wrong.
 I didn't say anything like that.
 Look, everything went fine. I didn't even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. The woman across the hall is into me.
 That's not a bad sign.
 I'm not there because I'm taking things slow. Which, by the way, compared to you guys approaches warp speed. And take down that camera.
 You could be Batman?
 Hey.
 Hey, Penny, if you're not doing anything Friday night I thought maybe we could go and see a movie.
 What about Saturday?
 Great. So you just let me know when you know. So…  Oh God, I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?
 What does that mean?
 No I didn't.
 What's going on with you?
 What's wrong with your face?
 What?
 Good day?
 What do you mean, you're moving out? Why?
 Yeah, there kind of does.
 I'm still confused.
 It's not you, Howard, he says he's moving out.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 I didn't do anything, he's just gone insane.
 That was fast.
 Where are you gonna live?
 This could work.
 I'm coming!
 What's with him?
 I still don't know why you left.
 Why not.
 You promised Penny what?
 What secret. Tell me the secret.
 Not that secret, the other secret.
 Dammit, Sheldon! You said Penny told you a secret, what was the secret.
 I promise.
 So it's nothing I did? It's her problem?
 Penny thinks I'm too smart for her, that's ridiculous.
 Yeah, hi, listen, I know what's been bothering you about us, and I have the answer.
 First I want to say that it's not Sheldon's fault, he tried very hard to keep your secret, if Howard hadn't drugged him he would have taken it to his grave.
 Yes, but it's okay. Now that we know what the problem is, there's a simple solution.
 A place for fun, a place for knowledge. See, this man here's playing hacky sack, and this girl's going to be a paralegal.
 Well, it's really not that fancy, it's just a city college.
 That doesn't matter to me at all.
 Absolutely. Okay, this time I know where I went wrong.  Oh bite me!
 Please let it go, Sheldon.
 You're nitpicking.
 Hi.
 So, yeah, good to see you.
 It wasn't awkward. It wasn't fun. Besides, what's the big deal, we dated, we stopped dating, and now we're both moving on.
 Can we please just go in, my chain mail is stuck in my underwear.
 Relatively modern. Why, what are you wearing?
 You went out and bought linen?
 Borrowed?
 You know what, I'm happy that Penny's moving on. It gives me the freedom to move on myself.
 Of course. Out of respect.
 What? I've dated plenty of women. There was Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle.
 Uh, what about that girl last year at Comic-con?
 Why not?
 What happened to you?
 Yes I have, it's just a matter of actually making a date with someone.
 Well, there's Joyce Kim, but she defected back to North Korea so it's a little geographically undesireable.
 Look, I like Leslie, but she's not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release.
 How?
 Hey, Leslie.
 Uh, sure.
 Where did you hear that?
 Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory. Yep.
 Are you suggesting another bout of stress release.
 Really, what changed?
 Yeah, I can see how that would… a bunch of people?
 Oh, I'm flattered. So, how do you suggest we proceed?
 Sounds fun.
 Thank you, that's very thoughtful.
 Terrific.
 I kind of have other plans tonight.
 Well, the thing is, someone's coming over.
 Sheldon, it's a date, I have a date coming over.
 Why, what's so unusual about me having a date?
 Alright, alright. Well, uh, nevertheless, I have one now and I would appreciate it if you would, you know, make yourself scarce.
 You know what I mean, could you just give us a little privacy?
 Yes.
 Yes.
 I know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy I would be more than happy to get out of your way.
 Yeah, it's from Changs.
 No, Changs.
 It changed.
 A little.
 I sure hope so.
 Okay, now my uncles are bald, but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you will ever meet. So… Sweet lady. It always tickles when she hugs me.  What now?
 Listen, I'm sorry about all of Sheldon's interruptions, he can be a bit of an eccentric.
 Well, I think tonight was a very good start.
 No problem, I'm very skilled at postponing intercourse. So I guess I'll call you and we'll arrange another evening.
 Sure.
 Hello.
 Okay, well, goodnight.
 Right.
 Hey, why don't we all move over there so Leslie can join us.
 Don't make this hard for me.
 You're right, it is simple.
 If the word is pee-pee, just do it.
 Thank you.
 Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories.
 Sheldon, don't make that noise, it's disrespectful.
 Sorry Leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy.
 Truth, what truth? We're talking about untested hypotheses, uh, it's no big deal.
 I guess we let them wait until they're old enough and let them choose their own theory.
 Wait, where are you going?
 What's the bright side?
 Oh yeah.
 Yeah, that's great, you guys want corn dogs?
 What's going on?
 Great, you know there are groceries outside of your apartment?
 I only bring it up because your ice-cream is melting and it's starting to attract wildlife.
 Want to catch me up?
 Uh-huh. Seriously, six months?
 Hey, check it out, it's just corn starch and water.
 Beats me. They were playing all last night too.
 No, that's Marcie. Peppermint Patty's just athletic.
 Sheldon, you want to catch me up again?
 Why should I do something, you're the one who introduced her to online gaming.
 Why don't you just tell her to leave you alone.
 Well, what am I supposed to do?
 You mean, up until now we've been experiencing the happy funtime Sheldon?
 I'll go talk to her.
 Hey Penny.
 Yeah, I see that. Shouldn't you be at work?
 It's Thursday. Listen, Penny.
 Okay, um, here's the thing, um, sometimes people, good people, you know, they start playing these games and they find themselves through no fault of their own, you know, kind of, addicted.
 Well, i-i-i-it's just if a person doesn't have a sense of achievement in their real life it's easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they get a false sense of accomplishment.
 Penny, you've got cheetos in your hair.
 Wow.
 Yeah, I know, I'm just a little concerned about you.
 Okay, maybe later.
 Hey.
 Penny's been keeping him up at night.
 She's gotten really hooked on Age of Conan, she's playing non-stop.
 Sheldon, wake up.
 That's not what she's doing, Leslie, she's just trying to shore up her self esteem, it has nothing to do with sex.
 Leslie, you are way off base here.
 Excuse me, this whole idea is insane.
 Sheldon…
 Hello.
 Hi Tom. Sheldon? Didn't I explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?
 Chosen by science?
 You got Penny to sign up for online dating?
 This is bad.
 Really, really bad.
 They never do.
 Let's see, Raj was the Kung Palo Chicken.
 Who was the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce?
 Don't! Don't! Don't!
 O-o-o-oh!
 Why? Don't!
 Penny, you don't have to do that.
 Oh yeah, two zero zero eight NQ sub seventeen.
 Well, wow, that's incredible.
 You'd do the dolphins.
 Are you proud of yourself?
 Hi Sheldon.
 Well, we're going to go apologise to Raj and invite him out to dinner.
 Well, he came over last night with some pretty good news, and we weren't very supportive.
 Really, do tell.
 Okay, let's try it this way, what if the People magazine thing is the best Raj is ever going to achieve?
 Come on.
 Not really, it's what you and I would call condescension.
 And when we go in there, let's show Raj that we're happy for him.
 Smile.
 We're here to see Koothrappali, not kill Batman.
 Close enough, come on. Hi Raj.
 Celebrate your thirty under thirty thing. Right Sheldon?
 Dr Gablehauser.
 Sheldon!
 Sheldon.
 Science?
 You can stop smiling now.
 No.
 Not yet.
 You just got him this afternoon.
 A lackey?
 Almost.
 Well, uh, no I… the… no.
 Now.
 Hey.
 You look very nice.
 Good night.
 Yeah.
 Terrific.
 Hey.
 Anythingforagreencard.com?
 You're joking.
 Pass.
 It's not a date, and that's racist.
 Let's just eat so I can get to bed. With any luck tonight will be the night my sleep apnoea kills me.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 You're welcome.
 Just sit down and eat.
 Alright, it's shredded, what do you want me to do?
 Sorry.
 He's not going to have intercourse with Penny.
 Do the shrimpers feature in your story?
 He's irony impaired, just move on.
 A griffin?
 And mythological.
 You want to breed a new friend?
 That may well be, but the fact is, it wouldn't kill us to meet some new people.
 If we do get a new friend, he should be a guy you can trust. A guy who has your back.
 Yeah, let's see, money, women, technology, okay we're agreed, our new friend is going to be Iron Man.
 Uh-huh.
 I'm not going to work.
 Sheldon, I was up all night using the new free-electron laser for my X-ray diffraction experiment.
 No.
 Didn't I tell you I'd be working nights, and that you'd have to make other arrangements.
 And?
 Goodnight, Sheldon.
 Take the bus.
 You tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords?
 Oh, you're a big boy, you'll figure it out.
 I just got here.
 Sheldon, I told you, I only have access to the free-electron laser at night. I can't drive you for the next few weeks.
 Howard, help me out here.
 How did you get here in the first place?
 Look, I need to get to the laser lab, you're just going to have to find someone else to take you home.
 Good morning.
 Sheldon, sit down.
 So we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it.
 Sheldon, you need to learn how to drive.
 Penny's taking you to the DMV, I'm going to bed.
 Because rock breaks scissors, goodnight.
 Booting.
 No.
 Okay, now, what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive.
 Okay, fasten your seat belt.
 You don't need air bags.
 Okay, now shift into drive, pull out slowly into traffic.
 Oh.
 Watch out.
 Watch, watch out, watch out for pedestrians!
 How did you manage to get on the second floor of the Glendale galleria?
 Maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow.
 Aw, the pet store?
 So wait,you're just gonna give up?
 So what is it you're doing?
 What does that mean?
 I wonder a lot of things about you, Sheldon, but not… not that.
 No kidding.
 Yes, you are, you're meant to learn how to drive. Please learn how to drive!
 It's never safe.
 Fine. Assuming that everything you say is true, how does the biologically superior Homo Novus get to work tomorrow morning?
 Well, hang in there, maybe you'll evolve into something with wings.
 Hey.
 No, he lives here now.
 Well, since he won't take the bus and he's too evolved to drive, he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office and shower in the radiation lab until I'm finished with my experiment.
 Yep
 So, if any of you are considering going into experimental physics, my door is always open. Once again, I'm sorry that the demonstration didn't quite work out, but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach Snapple into a helium neon laser. Short answer is… don't. And now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Dr. Cooper?
 Excuse me. Sheldon, we both agreed to do this.
 If you don't do this, I won't take you to the comic book store.
 Oh, good God.
 Laser demonstration's looking pretty good now, huh?
 No, if you can talk to them, you can ask them out.
 Hey, Leslie.
 Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.
 Hey, Ramona. Come on in.
 Uh, the kitchen's fine. Hey, what are you doing?
 Uh-huh. The viewing area's right over there. Sheldon, your girl… date… person… Ramona's here.
 Oh, yeah. No, we were just going.
 No, come on, now, we're going out.
 Let's go. Okay, you two, just, have a nice… whatever this is.
 What do you mean “deal”?
 Honestly, we've been operating under the assumption that he has no deal.
 On the other hand, I think Sheldon might be the larval form of his species, and someday he'll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton.
 Hey, do you want to hang out with us?
 Uh…
 The one with the little onions? Mmm.
 Don't.
 Hey, aren't you having breakfast?
 Are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again?
 So, how'd it go with Ramona last night?
 Touche.
 Ah, hey Leslie.
 Wait for me.
 Hey, Penny.
 Why? What are they doing?
 Hoo-boy.
 Yeah, I can see that. Sheldon, Halo night, Koothrappali's. You coming?
 Seriously? You're not coming?
 Okay, well, once again, you guys have a good… whatever this is.
 Sheldon? What are you doing?!
 Why?
 We are communicating through the wall.
 I don't know Morse code.
 Sheldon, I'm not going to learn Morse code at three o'clock in the morning!
 Don't come in here, don't come in here, don't come in here, don't Aw! What's going on?
 I know. When is she going home?
 What are you talking about?
 That only applies if you need me to help you destroy an artificial intelligence you created that's taking over the Earth.
 Good night.
 The bodysnatchers clause requires me to help you destroy someone we know who's been replaced with an alien pod.
 Not unless she destroys Tokyo.
 Sheldon, do you see what just happened here?
 Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?
 That's it. No more Thai food.
 Okay, I have pokh.
 Potl.
 Pukhpa.
 Really? Define it.
 No, no, don't tell her.
 Aw!
 They're gorgeous.
 Yeah, and they can all move in with you and your mother, the current Mrs. Wolowitz.
 Hey, wh-where are you going?
 Did I miss anything? Did they kick Giselle off?
 Sheldon, the food's here.
 What are you doing?
 Why?
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 I asked.
 No.
 Yes.
 No.
 Just eat.
 Here you go.
 Put it on the agenda.
 Oh, I'll make a motion, but you're not going to like it.
 Sheldon's onion ring. Just put it back!
 No, no, no,  no, I don't think that's where it was.
 Penny! Penny did it.
 Don't worry. They only stay on your record for a year.
 Congratulations. You're officially one of us.
 Yeah, yeah. Uh, see, here's the thing, after you leave, I still have to live with him.
 Listen, don't worry. I'll talk to him.
 Just so I know, would you be open to taking his class? You can do it online!
 To do what?
 Are you insane? You're not going to party with them, you're not even going to get anywhere near that place.
 Thank you.
 Penny, can I talk to you for a minute? Hi.
 Look, here's the thing, um, I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line.
 Yeah, so just apologize to him, okay?
 Oh, come on, it's easy, he'll even tell you what to say.
 We're not encouraging. It's more like knuckling under.
 Well, actually, technically, you did do it.
 You can recognize people on Google Earth?
 NORAD? You're using military aircraft?
 Sheldon? I just dropped him off at the comic book store. Why?
 Problem with the WiFi?
 I reiterate, knuckle under.
 Oh, Penny, you don't want to get into it with Sheldon. The guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain.
 There, see? Problem solved.
 Thanks a lot, Howard.
 Hey, you guys are talking again. Good. What happened?
 Oh, not junior rodeo. What did you do?
 A-a-a-aw!
 No. Look, this has to stop.
 All right, I really didn't want to do this, but… here.
 Sheldon's Kryptonite.
 He can never know that I gave that to you.
 It'll shorten the war by five years and save millions of lives.
 Okay, for the record what you're doing is really creepy.
 Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. I'll get him. Sheldon, it's for you.
 Your mother.
 Are you kidding me? I already have two strikes.
 Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.
 Well, five is partway between three… Never mind.
 Ahoy, matey.
 Or in this case, the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye.
 You're not gonna need wingman, you're gonna need a paramedic.
 Well, I want to watch it now.
 Watch whatever you want.
 Hello. Hey, Howard. What's wrong? Okay. Okay, we'll be right there.
 Howard's at the Mars Rover lab. He says he's in trouble. Defcon 5.
 What?
 How can 5 not be worse than 1?
 Can we just forget I said Defcon and go?
 What's the emergency?
 Wait a minute, so the eye patch and the insults worked?
 Okay.
 No one's a scientist like Howard.
 Just said Howard's a terrific guy. He's got a great sense of humour, he loves his mother, a lot, some people say too much.
 Yeah, I am loyal. You know, if you look at the big picture. Just, out of curiosity, did he ever have a shot with you?
 Then why did you?
 Got it. So, can I see you again?
 Ooh. Cool.
 Psst! Psst!
 Yeah. Listen, I have to kinda sneak out for a while.
 No, wait! If anyone asks you where I went, you don't know.
 I can't tell you that.
 I can't tell you that, either.
 Yeah, I really didn't think this through.
 What?
 I don't know. Just tell them I went to the office.
 No.
 Just say, Leonardrd went to the office.
 What is? No, not like that! Just, Leonardrd went to the office.
 I'm going to the office.
 I'm going out for a while.
 So how was work today?
 I'm hoping that's three different guys.
 Oh, you know, I'm a physicist, so, I thought about stuff.
 Well, I wrote some of it down.
 Uh, yeah.
 If I knew you were waiting, I would've swallowed that lasagna whole.
 I've had her brisket. Melts in your mouth.
 That's a good idea. There's a bed in there, and I'm very, very, very pro-bed.
 Don't you think we should tell him you're not interested?
 Dear God, no!
 Hey.
 Yeah, a couple.
  Thank you.
 I'm sorry?
 So, uh, what we did was in fact dating?
 Exactly. Thank you. Do me a favour, tell Koothrappali that next time you see him.
 Oh, she's a doctor.
 Doctor doctor. Surgical resident. Smart, pretty. Let me ask you something. If your friend thinks he's dating someone, but he's not because, in fact, you're dating her, does that make you a bad person?
 On what?
 Yeah.
 Are you sure?
 Does that change things?
 So why'd you ask?
 Listen, I need to talk to you about something.
 Oh, hey, guys.
 Hi, Howard. Howard?
 That's just ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him?
 Howard, come on, I didn't plan on this. These things just happen. Usually not to me, but they do happen.
 Oh, hi, Steph, come on in.
 Yeah, but I don't see a better one on the horizon, so…
 He just won't listen to me.
 Hmm. Lisa's gonna be disappointed.
 Howard, Howard, look at this.
 I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
 I stand corrected.
 She doesn't mean it. She's just being nice.
 Uh, Sheldon?
 Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?
 Okay, here's my question, why did you sit down?
 What landing party?
 Oh, my god, what did you do?
 Oo-oo-oh!
 What invitation?
 Oh, clearly I could have.
 Not the right seats. 
 He's finding the acoustic sweet spot.
 Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone. I am really sorry about this.
 No, just sit here.
 What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon?
 The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?
 Stephanie Barnett is single.
 It's just her facebook page and we've only been going out a couple of weeks.
 Okay, I'm going to make this very simple for you. You are not in this relationship, I am. Ergo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and Stephanie.
 General Order 104, Section A does not apply in this situation.
 Because this is not Star Trek
 All I'm saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria, why can't they do something about lactose intolerance?
 Want some more wine?
 What are you doing?
 Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you?
 By making constipated moose sounds?
 Huh? Would it work if I just punched you in the face?
 Oh, for god's sakes.
 No, no, no, I got it.
 No, I'm not. I'm bleeding.
 Stitches? With a needle?
 Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec.
 I can't remember a time when you weren't talking.
 I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery.
 She stuck a needle into my hand!
 I didn't cry.
 Oh, are you still going to spend the night?
 Thank you, Dr. Cooper.
 What?
 Hey, can you open this for me?
 Sure.
 What for?
 What? no. no, that's not right.
 It's not bold, it's a mistake. I didn't change my status.
 You hacked my facebook account?
 Are you insane? Now she's going to think I'm desperate. You've destroyed this relationship! And you want to know what the worst part is? You don't even understand what you did wrong because you can't conceive of something that you are not an expert in!
 Don't even! I don't want to hear another word out of you.
 Really? Oh, look at that, I have a girlfriend.
 Me, too.
 No, it's more of a relentless, narcissistic drone.
 Maybe it's a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies.
 Okay, I'll be right in.
 Do you understand that Stephanie's not here to treat your imaginary ailments?
 Good night.
 No, you're not.
 Thank you.
 We're not living together.
 That's absurd.
 Wait, I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen! I initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers.
 I'm going to bed.
 No, absolutely not.
 I don't care what the symptoms are, my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam.
 Oh come on! Sheldon, we don't ask questions like that.
 She's heard about you because we're, you know, involved and you haven't heard about her because… I never slept with her, I swear!
 Thank you, Sheldon.
 Look, I'm just saying, um, Penny is one of our many neighbours, you know, and in our building, neighbours come and go, it's very casual, no dress code. In fact, some mornings I'll just mosey down to the third floor in my pyjamas and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.
 She doesn't like you. Um, well, uh, you have a gall bladder to remove and I have to get in the shower and Penny has clothes to put on, so…
 Okay, bye-bye.
 Why do I feel like I'm the one that just got the prostate exam?
 We're not living together.
 We're not living together.
 How could I not be sure?
 Don't you think if a woman was living with me I'd be the first one to know about it?
 We're not living together.
 We're not living together.
 Uh, the big dog is Goofy, and the older couple with the mouse ears , I have no idea. We're not living together!
 We're not… Where's my Bat Signal?
 I did. It was right here. She must've… Oh, my God, we're living together.
 Yeah, Stephanie got them for me.
 Actually, I think it's more of wool, fire ant blend.
 It is actually. In fact, I gave it a lot of thought and I decided it was time for us to live together.
 At least I have an egg. What do you have?
 So, go hit on her.
 I don't care what you guys think, Stephanie and I are very happy living together. I will give either of you 20 dollars, right now to trade pants with me.
 Oh, good. Do you have any fabric softener?
 No, the pants that Stephanie got me.
 Are you sure?
 Oh, no. I wish you'd told me that sooner.
 No, everything's fine.
 Yeah. It's wonderful. Okay, maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly, but it's fine, it's great.
 Are you sure? That doesn't sound right.
 No that doesn't sound right either.
 Yeah, I could say something like that to her. I'll go do that. Thank you.
 You have a really good grasp on this. Maybe you could talk to her?
 No, but that's okay. I'll go talk to her. Want to come with?
 Hey.
 Sheldon. What's going on?
 Careful, if you don't get it all, it'll only come back worse.
 Listen, we need to talk.
 I don't know what that means.
 Okay, um, well, look, it's just that things between you and me have been going pretty quick.
 It's just a little scary.
 Sure, when is scary not good? But, okay, um, I have feelings, right?
 Okay, and it's perfectly okay to express those feelings, right?
 Okay, well, I ju… I think it's important to remember that we move at a pace that is our speed and… oh, shoot, I had it!
 What's that? Really? Right now?
 I just ate, aren't you supposed to wait an hour?
 Oh, okay. I just hope I don't get cramps.
 Hey.
 Thank you.
 Good.
 Well, um, on one level, really, really well.
 Not specifically, but, uh, I did tell her that I had feelings.
 And then the, the subject got changed somehow.
 Um, little bit. What?
 Yeah, yeah it's all good. Everything's going to work out. One way or another.
 Really?
 Huh.
 Nothing, just rethinking my whole life. Okay, here's the thing, I'm afraid that if I ask her to move out, she'll just dump me.
 Very comforting. Okay, so what do I say to her?
 I really like you, but I want to see how things go with Mark?
 Oh, right, yeah, um, so, Stephanie, here's the thing. I really like you.
 What speech?
 No! No, no! I wasn't going to say any of that. I was just going to say, I really like you.
 Terrific.
 Hey.
 Yeah, Stephanie got it for me. It's kind of fun.
 Yeah, yeah, that's the fun part. We're also getting new curtains for my bedroom, and a dust ruffle, and a duvet, and I don't even know what a duvet is but I'm pretty sure if I did I wouldn't want one, but every time I talk to her about moving out she cries and we have sex.
 Isn't that kind of cowardly?
 Sold. “I think it would be better for our relationship if you moved back to your place.” There. It's done.
 Yeah, good for me. I'll never have sex again. I was wrong. See ya.
 Raj, please, let's stay serious here. Superman's body is Kryptonian, therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.
 It's David Underhill. So what?
 I have two words for you. The first is big, the other's whoop.
 Did not.
 Did… okay, maybe  some of it, but, look, the guy was just in the right place, at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting reinterpretation of the universe. He got lucky.
 Uh, yeah.
 Uh, y-yeah.
 You want to work with me?
 Wow, y-yeah, sure. Yeah, no problem. Uh, Here's my home number, here's my cell, here's my office, here's my parents' number up in New Jersey, they always know how to reach me. So…
 Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant, by the way. Big fan.
 Okay. Bye-bye! What are you looking at?You've never seen a hypocrite before?
 Hey, guys!
 Actually, I was…
 Come on, it's just a video game. And we suck at it.
 I was working with Dave Underhill.
 Actually, he's pretty cool. I mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist, but it turns out he's a Black Diamond skier, he collects vintage motorcycles, he plays in a rock band.
 No, we play Rock Band on our X-Box.
 He's funny, too. He does this hysterical impersonation of Stephen Hawking having phone sex. What are you wearing? That's not, he does it better. Anyway, he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow, so I'm gonna go practice my situps.
 Ow! Ow!
 Yeah, I guess.
 Thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle.
 I had no idea it was so heavy. The thing just fell right over on me, didn't it?
 Oh, yeah. It's just a little motorcycle accident.
 I don't know. It's all such a blur.
 Yeah, lucky for the bike it landed on my leg.
 I'm not indoorsy. I just wear the appropriate sun block because I don't take melanoma lightly.
 Yeah, we're examining the radiation levels of photomultiplier tubes for a new dark matter detector.
 Since when?
 Since when?
 Uh, yeah. I guess.
 Yeah, if you like that type.
 No, just neighbours.
 Actually, science is my lady.
 See ya. ‘Bye, Penny. Have fun.
 What it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla. It's as if my head were trapped in the pyjamas of a sultan.
 Oh, hey, Dave. And Penny, what a surprise.
 Yeah, I know. I've been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga.
 Maybe I heard you wrong. A lot of words sound like yoga.
 Yes, please shut up. So, um, Dave, don't you think you and I should get back to the lab? You know, that dark matter isn't going to detect itself.
 That's funny. By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
 Yippee.
 Brilliant.
 Do whatever you want.
 My leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
 Okay, I have just one question for you. While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us, you said that you didn't want to go out with me because I was too smart for you! Well, news flash, lady, David Underhill is ten times smarter than me! You'd have to drive a railroad spike into his brain for me to beat him at checkers! Next to him, I'm like one of those sign-language gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes! So, my question is, what's up with that?
 Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Never mind, we're cool.
 Really? Why would you say that?
 He tried to take nude photos of you?
 Oh, yeah. I'm so… oh, that's terrible.
 Well, uh, the important thing is he's married and that's terrible!
 Lactose.
 Smooth.
 Come on, it's Christmas, just give me this one.
 By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
 Merry Christmas.
 Very good, thanks for asking. Come on in.
 Oh, a gift certificate for motorcycle lessons. Very thoughtful.
 Oh, then, I think you'll appreciate what I got you.
 You know, 'cause you're so into science.
 It's a Saturnalia miracle.
 MONTE.
 Maybe we should start small.
 How about the toaster oven?
 What did I ever do to Jimmy Mullins in the third grade? He still punched me in the face with my own fists. Sorry, you little nerd, you were just in the wrong boys' room at the wrong time.
 That'll do it.
 Uh-huh?
 Killer robot. We built it.
 Howard, why don't we just work on the robot?
 I'm begging you, stop talking.
 Howard, where you going?
 Wow.
 He said maybe we should enter you in the killer robot competition.
 I don't know, now they're just yelling about Popsicles. Sounds like Penny really got to him.
 Yes, we did, Kripke.
 Come on, is that really necessary?
 No, don't make it so. Barry, we can't fight you tomorrow, our engineer is incapacitated.
 Hey, you got a minute?
 I need you to apologize to How…
 Come on. Wolowitz won't come out of his house and we need him for a robot battle.
 The robot didn't hurt his feelings.
 He's been in bed for two days.
 He's not with a… does it really matter who or what he's with? The guy is devastated.
 Okay, don't take this as a criticism, but you kind of have that overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on.
 You know, like, most of the time, you're the easygoing Bruce Banner, but then, when you get angry, you kind of turn into, like, you know, grrrrr!
 Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner? You didn't get The Incredible Hulk from that? Never mind, just, please go talk to him.
 Well, maybe you can go at it from a different angle, like, um, you see a glimmer of goodness in him and you only said what you said because you want to nurture it and make it shine.
 Okay, let's try it this way. Remember the day that we first met and you asked me to go to your boyfriend's apartment to get your TV back and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said… what was that? What did you say? Oh, yes, you said you owed me one.
 I came home with no pants.
 Thank you. I should probably give you a heads up about his mother.
 She's a delightful woman. You'll love her.
 Oh, my God. That's Kripke's robot?
 Sheldon, we have to call it off.
 Oh, please, we've spent our whole lives running away from fights. Personally, I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size.
 You want to prepare him? Install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself.
 Not yet.
 Nice little bot you've got here.
 What's this do, spin?
 Neat. Good work. Sheldon, we've got to call this off.
 I just want to make sure that we're all clear, standard robotic fighting league rules apply.
 Run, Monte, run!
 Go, go, go, go!
 Well, so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood.
 Forget the robot. What happened to you?
 Penny.
 Ah, no kidding! A Fu Man Chu? A handlebar pencil?
 Alright this is cruel, we better let him finish before his head explodes.
 Hey Kripke.
 Alright, please don't cheer me up anymore.
 Good luck getting time on it. The only people he lets use it are his friends.
 There you go. Now any e-mail from Wolowitz will go right into your spam folder.
 Yeah, I got the same one. And that's not a bathing suit, it's a tan line.
 Oh he's trying to make a new friend.
 Well, unless he's makes one out of wood like Gepetto, I don't think it's gonna happen.
 There was a flier on the bulletin board at the university. Roommate wanted. Whistlers need not apply.
 I assumed he was joking. You'd be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side.
 I don't know, how do carbon atoms form a benzene ring? Proximity and valence electrons.
 I suppose. I do miss whistling though.
 I answered every question Sheldon.
 Aw, you picked up on that huh?
 Come on! There's over 200 questions. And look at some of these things. Sheldon is to camaraderie, as the space shuttle is to blank?
 Hold on. I put some real work into that!
 It's kinda cute, until you get to the scrotum.
 Sheldon, I'm not going to defend a big-balled raccoon.
 What I'm trying to say is that, maybe you can't approach this as a purely intellectual exercise.
 Well, remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the internet?
 On the floor.
 Then why learn how to swim?
 No! no, my point is, if you want to learn how to make friends, then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum. Meet people. Talk to them. Take an interest in their lives.
 Where are we going?
 Why don't you just lie down on the floor and swim there?
 Okay, if you're gonna start sniffing people, I'm gonna go get a hot pretzel.
 Sheldon, what are you doing?
 No you're not, let's go.
 Don't look up, there's cameras.
 Lysine.
 Sheldon, there is no algorithm for making friends!
 Yes, he's new at the zoo.
 Uh-oh, he's stuck in an infinite loop.
 I'm sorry. Can we please just do it one more time?
 It's a little thing but you really do miss it.
 Oh…
 How was rock climbing?
 Want some Chinese food?
 In the bathroom.
 What's that?
 Can I whistle?
 He had Lysine but changed it.
 I didn't think he had it in him.
 Hmmm.
 We've got to be missing something. Let's start again. The movie is playing here at 7
 Why? They're state-of-the-art digital projection, 20-channel surround sound.
 Well, it's gonna take at least an hour to eat, and I don't see a Sheldon-approved restaurant proximate to a Sheldon-approved theatre.
 Sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis, to create an emergency ad-hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency?
 Bye, Sheldon.
 Interesting.
 Do I have to?
 Why?
 Hey, Penny. How was work?
 Stop it!
 He's not lying, he does find that fascinating.
 Weird.
 Did you guys have an argument?
 Well, you clearly did something to aggravate her.
 Here you go. Oh, you owe me another two dollars. The price of mu-shu pork went up.
 Here you go, Penny. Shrimp with lobster sauce.
 Don't worry about it. It's my treat.
 It's, whatever. Ten, eleven dollars.
 Fourteen fifty, but it's no biggie, you'll get the next one.
 It was fourteen fifty, but it's okay.
 Oh, wait, you lent her money?
 Where are you going?
 But if you're ever short, there's always a couple of fifties in Green Lantern's ass.
 Hey.
 A little mood lighting, huh?
 Yeah, they're very considerate that way.
 Fourteen dollars, huh?
 Back in the pocket it goes. Look, you do understand that Sheldon really doesn't care when he gets the money back. It's actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn't make you want to, you know, kill him.
 So you're a little behind on your bills. Everybody gets behind on their bills.
 Well, what was the plan?
 Was there a plan B?
 It's probably not as bad as you think. Let's take a look. Maybe we can find some corners to cut. Oh, here's something, if you don't have electricity, then you probably don't need cable. Just a suggestion. 170 dollars for acting classes?
 You've had an acting job where you got paid?
 Actually, it kind of… let's keep looking. Whoa, what's eighteen hundred dollars to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?
 Nothing? It sounds like you got caught speeding going 4,000 miles an hour.
 Your ex-boyfriend?
 What?
 I would hope so.
 Did he pay you back?
 And that's based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?
 Well what are you gonna do?
 Oh, no. Oh, you don't want to do that.
 Well, moving is a big deal. You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes, and if they're not clean, then your books smell like melons, and it's just, like… Why don't you just get a roommate and stay here?
 Well, I'm sure the guy living with Sheldon wouldn't mind moving in with you.
 Really?
 Hey, what's going on?
 Hey, you guys want to go on a real live quest?
Come on. It'll be fun.
 Do you guys remember Penny's ex-boyfriend Kurt? Yeah, that's him. It turns out he owes Penny a lot of money, and I'm gonna go get it from him. Who's with me?
 Really? You're just gonna let me go by myself?
 I could use some help.
 You guys are unbelievable, you play a game to simulate adventure, but when there's real adventure out there in the real world, you just wimp out.
 I do.
 I'm not afraid of him.
 Excuse me. When Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor, didn't Samwise, Pippin and Merry go with him?
 Well?
 Fine. Just enjoy your little game. I'll make this quest on my own.
 You guys suck. Come on, please? He's so big.
 Okay, is everyone clear on the plan?
 Guys, there are four of us and one of him.
 Okay, how about this? I'll do the talking, you just stand behind me and try to look formidable.
 Hi, Kurt.
 I don't really go by Lenny, but that's okay. Um, you remember Sheldon, Howard and Raj.
 Sheldon, not now.
 Okay, here it is. Penny's in kind of a financial jam, and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solving her problems.
 No, no, she's too proud to ask for the money. I, on the other hand, feel you should honour your debt.
 Feel is a kind of a… it's a strong word. Um, I just think it would be a nice gesture on your part.
 No, the problem isn't solved. He just blew us off.
 No. You can leave if you want to. I'm gonna see this through.
 I guess, technically, that was my fault. I'm not leaving here without Penny's money.
 I don't need backup. I have right on my side. And I'm wearing cargo shorts under my pants.
 Hey.
 Yeah. Hang on. Sheldon!
 It's kind of a fashionable look these days.
 Hey, I know it's none of my business, but where did the money come from?
 Really? Did he say why?
 That's it? Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?
 Bye.
 Penny's hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have indelible ink on my forehead!
 Great.
 I'm really very busy. Is there any way that we can put this off until I have more time to prepare? Of course. But, uh, you understand my trepidation.
 Can't we just postpone it till the spring? Maybe next summer?
 No, I didn't realize it had been so long. Sure, I guess there's no other choice but to just go ahead and do it.
 Aren't there any other options? There's not a lot of room, it's gonna be uncomfortable.
 Okay, bye. My mother's coming to visit.
 Good to see you, Mother.
 Here's your tea, Mother.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 I'll start again.
 Here's your tea, Mother. So, what are you guys talking about?
 Swell. If you're lucky, maybe she'll show you the PowerPoint presentation.
 So, Mother, what's new?
 All right. Uh, what's new with you?
 Maybe something less personal.
 Oh, my God. What happened?
 Yeah I, I thought you guys might hit it off.
 I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.
 Sheldon, you don't give your mother enough credit. She's warm, she's loving, she doesn't glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training.
 Please, don't go there, Howard.
 Boy, you suck.
 Why are you doing this?
 You know, rather than mock me, my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it.
 That was fast.
 Howard lives with his mother and Raj can't speak to women unless he's drunk. Go.
 He lives in the same room where his bassinet was.
 You brought your husband to work, you know the rules. Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha.
 There's no hurry, Mother, tell them more about their secret love for each other.
 Fine. Let's go. I think you'll find my work pretty interesting. I'm attempting to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians.
 No.
 You got alcohol?
 Yep.
 Oh, relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan.
 Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.
 She's only been here a day and a half and I'm seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.
 You can't let her get into your head.
 It's too late for me. My head is her summer house.
 Oh, yeah, there she is. Hi, Mom.
 Did you get the part?
 Hey, you want to talk about not getting love from a parent. You know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact?
 Of course she did. Anyway, that's not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old, I built a hugging machine.
 Yeah. I got a dressmaker's mannequin, I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back.
 You know what the saddest part was?
 My father used to borrow it.
 Uh-huh.
 I'm sorry, I didn't hear anything after lick.
 Right. Ah! Where's the lime? Oh, okay, we're sharing.
 This is actually gonna happen.
 You shush, I'm happy, I want to talk about it. You know what my mother would say about this? She would say because you were not loved by your father and I was not loved by my mother, that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn't get as children.
 I don't know. Foreplay?
 Ummm, I'm gonna go with “no.”
 Come on, you're trying to have sex with your father, and I'm okay with that.
 She said shush. I should have shushed.
 All right, Mother. Um, have a nice flight.
 Morning.
 You don't have to. Ever.
 Good-bye, Mother.
 There's no way we can get to the ridge. The Chemistry Department has us completely cut off.
 I forget. Which one is Hammer of the Gods?
 No, that shouldn't be a problem, Venus is up during the day. They're probably just all staring at the sky.
 Howard, why aren't you covering us? We're getting slaughtered out here!
 Yeah, more cutbacks.
 You know what baffles me, Sheldon?
 Hey, Leslie.
 Yeah, okay, but what's with the back-scratching and the meow!
 Thank you.
 Are you done?
 What about it, Howard?
 I don't care about that.
 You and Leslie?
 And the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone.
 Calm down. We'll figure it out.
 Here we go.
 Don't sit in his spot.
 Okay, that should do it.
 That's a lot of shoes you ordered.
 Yeah. You ought to come out with us sometime.
 There's a chance.
 We? No, no, no, you had your chance to be we for, like, a year and a half now. Right now, you are you, and you are screwed.
 Well, we're not gonna tell him I did it.
 Just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun?
 We could tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend.
 Mm, butt print. There's no discernible butt print.
 It's too small and too perfect.
 You're welcome.
 Sheldon! How was the comic book store?
 Great, great. Did you walk the whole way? It's a little chilly.
 Isn't that terrific? He is such a good friend. You know what the best thing about friends is?
 No, no, friends forgive the little things.
 Don't you dare, missy.
 What do you mean?
 I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, that. Penny did that.
 Why don't you just eat in your desk chair?
 Wackadoodle.
 If it were your head, it would be.
 Oh, for God's sake, Sheldon.
 No, it's Leslie Winkle. It's a long story.
 I thought we were going to play Halo tonight.
 That's not fair. You're not even a physicist.
 Get out.
 Why are you crouching there?
 I don't know. Texas?
 Really? Great. Sheldon, look. Good as new.
 Nothing, it's what's wrong with him.
 Penny, Penny, I think I know what to do. Sheldon, I have some bad news.
 I'm afraid so. You know the cashew chicken I get you Monday nights?
 Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.
 Golden Dragon.
 Yeah, well, before they went out of business, I bought 4,000 containers. I keep them in the trunk of my car.
 I thought that might take his mind off the cushion.
 Oh, God, I wish I had.
 Yeah, buddy?
 Okay, first of all, Penny, thank you for coming.
 Penny is an amazing shot. I think we have a real chance to win this week.
 Okay. Now, we all run out. Sheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees. Raj, Howard and Leslie flank to the right behind the rocks. Then we'll all have a great view as Penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight.
 What is it, Sheldon? 
 Sheldon, Penny was our only hope.
 He's right. You can't.
 Where are you going?
 Okay, then we won't touch the hard drive. We'll just erase the first season of Battlestar.
 It's perfect.
 It's just for my notebooks. Thanks, Penny.
 This conference is kind of a big thing. The keynote address is being delivered by George Smoot.
 You've heard of him?
 Yeah, I wish.
 Well, we had a vote. Three of us voted for airplane, Sheldon voted for train, so we're taking the train.
 Hey, we're all going over to the Apple store to make fun of the guys at the Genius Bar. You want to come?
 What are you doing?
 Well, that does sound much simpler. How long is this going to take?
 Wow. Teasing the guys at the Apple store seems a little redundant now.
 I wouldn't expect you to. I'll see you later.
 Why not?
 Sheldon, we've been on this train 90 seconds, and you've already said a thousand words. Just tell us where to sit and shut up.
 Yeah, maybe. Meanwhile back in the 21st century, people are raising their tray tables and putting their seat-backs in an upright position 'cause it's time to land in San Francisco.
 Oh, look, now he's boring on an international scale.
 Is that who I think it is?
 Maybe John Connor's aboard and she's protecting him from an evil Terminator.
 Thank you.
 At least he's off the train crap.
 My money's on tuck and roll.
 Excuse me, but what about me? Why don't I get a shot?
 You know, I've already got a gorgeous blonde back home at I can't score with. I think I'll let you two take this one.
 So aren't you going to go talk to her?
 She's probably heard every possible line, Howard. Why don't you just try hello?
 You're going to need more than 11 hours.
 What's the matter?
 So?
 Okay, Sheldon, I'm going to say why and your answer cannot be because I forgot my flash drive.
 Why do you have to give your paper to George Smoot?
 So you'll send him an e-mail when we get back.
 Right. Of course.
 Well, there's nothing you can do about it, so relax, sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails.
 Only ten hours, 55 minutes to go.
 I've got a better idea.
 Boy, you take all the fun out of it for me.  But look, Penny's home. Why don't we just call her, have her go in the apartment, get your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?
 So?
 So?
 So?
 I see. Well, it seems once again, you're caught between a rock and a crazy place.
 Give me the phone. Hi, Penny. It's Leonardrd.
 He's calling to ask you a favour. You might be confused because he didn't use the words, Penny, Sheldon, please or favour.
 Is that what he's drinking? It's not even real beer.
 Look at it. Non-alcoholic beer.
 I don't know. Some sort of placebo effect, I guess.
 Hey, Penny. It's Leonardrd.
 Delightful. Listen, I don't know what you're doing right now, but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of Sheldon's mouth.
 Thank you.
 Hey, Penny. Leonardrd again.
 Hey, how'd it go?
 Excuse me. Okay, I'll be honest with you. I've just spent the last two hours imagining various scenarios in my head, trying to come up with some clever line to say to you. But then I finally realized you're a human being; I'm a human being. I could just say to you…
 Hi, my name's Leonardrd.
 Ready.
 Damn it. I slipped.
 Why?
 So?
 Ah.
 Believe me, Howard, any girl who would be willing to play that, you don't want to see naked.
 Cheeseburger. I get a cheeseburger.
 Let's go. We're going to miss the coming attractions.
 Hello?
 W-W-Wait, what's going on?
 Terrific, but that kind of raises more questions than it answers.
 What if we infused the bottom layer with silicone-RTV to provide a better mounting surface?
 She'd need some kind of industrial cooling system.
 Where?
 Are you thinking about adding a desiccant like calcium sulphate?
 Oh!
 Hey, we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab.
 Uh, hey, it's your business. Do whatever you want.
 I'm still tweaking things a little bit, but this will give you the general idea of the Web site. So, what do you guys think?
 Okay, what's wrong with it?
 Not you. I wasn't asking you. Penny?
 No, it doesn't.
 You want to fire me?
 Excuse me, but if I did such a bad job then why do we already have orders?
 Uh-huh. Look. Mrs. Fiona Fondell from Huntsville, Alabama has ordered two.
 Uh-huh. Look at the comments.
 Holy crap. Someone just ordered a thousand Penny Blossoms.
 The Fifth Annual East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance Luau.
 Amazon offers one-day rush.
 Don't yell at me. I'm not manufacturing. I'm just Web design.
 What are you doing?
 How are we doing?
 Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah…
 Sheldon, we still have 380 of these things to make.
 Yeah, no. But, Sheldon, without your insight and leadership this entire enterprise will surely fail.
 Bam.
 I can't believe we actually did it.
 I'll print out the shipping label. Uh-oh.
 We got an e-mail from the East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance. They want another thousand Penny Blossoms.
 One-day rush. I really need to take that off the Web site.
 Davy Crockett. Jiminy Crockett was a cricket.
 Sorry. My apologies to the gay community of East Rutherford, New Jersey.
 Sheldon, it's not that bad.
 So they steamed your dumplings, get over it. New topic, please.
 Shh-shh-shh!
 No!
 Why would you just say something like that?
 Slowly, like putting a new fish in a tank. You don't just drop it in, you let the bag sit in the water a while.
 Why are you making it worse?
 What?
 I'm sorry, that really is how it works.
 Raj, help me out here.
 Hey, Penny, it's Leonardrd. Good news, you can take your head out of the oven.
 Stay calm, we don't know anything about them yet. What are you doing?
 The box says kitchen.
 Hello.
 Hello.
 That is so great. Oh, I'm Leonardrd, I live downstairs. Upstairs from here, but under you. Not under you per se, but under your apartment.
 Yeah, it is.
 Sheldon…
 You're making her uncomfortable.
 Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help.
 Hey, Penny. this is Alicia, our new neighbour.
 I'm helping.
 I think you look fantastic.
 Hey, uh, penny, you want to hear something awesome?
 Alicia is an actress, just like you.
 Alicia, what do you want as your default setting for DVDs, 5.1 Dolby or DTS?
 Well, DTS has more low end, so… okay.
 It's a little insulting, don't you think?
 Uh, yeah, I'd love to.
 Yeah, I'll get to it, don't nag me.
 Gee, Penny, thanks for buying us dinner.
 You want to watch Battlestar?
 What's wrong?
 Oh, I'd watch that.
 Okay, well, I'll take you.
 Golden age green lantern was vulnerable to wood.
 What are you doing?
 I had to, she called me cutie.
 Problem?
 Yes, but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday.
 Sheldon, we agreed we'd do something different tonight.
 Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box, Sheldon.
 Come on, Howard, the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero.
 You're joking.
 You're right. It's Anything Can Happen Thursday, let's hit the clubs and meet hot women!
 Or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.
 Oh, absolutely.
 Sure. What does he like?
 You know this can go on all night, why don't you just come with us?
 Don't worry, they're more scared of you than you are of them.
 Come on, I'll help you pick something.
 Oh, hey, Stuart. This is Penny. She's looking for some comic books.
 I think we're fine, Stuart.
 You mean for someone who's into comic books?
 Penny, just because people appreciate comic books doesn't make them weirdos. Stuart's a terrific artist. He went to the Rhode Island School of Design.
 Ah, yeah, that's Captain Sweatpants. He doesn't really help the point I'm trying to make.
 Problem?
 Uh, cut it in half?
 I don't believe it. Stuart's putting the moves on Penny.
 Nobody's up in anybody's business, let's just buy our stuff and go.
 Apparently so.
 No.
 When did you pick up on that?
 Sure, why not?
 Gee, thanks a lot.
 I don't need any insights. I just want to know why Penny's more interested in Stuart than me. We're practically the same guy.
 You're right, I really should be asking strangers on the Internet.
 Hey, Penny… and Stuart, hey Stuart.
 And you guys are going together, great…
 Hey, Howard?
 Take me to a bar with women.
 Yeah.
 Why?
 Do you…? Let's go.
 Should we talk to some of these women?
 That's your system?
 How about those two?
 What about the ones in the corner?
 I think Blinky's cute.
 Wait, so we just go over there?
 What else you got?
 No.
 I thought you were good at this. You're always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.
 Well, what happened? We've been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you've had with a woman was when your mom called.
 Say what?
 Fine. I'll sit here. You take flight and hunt.
 Actually, you can. There's a whole sport built around it. Falconry.
 Yes
 Yes
 God, I hope not. And no, I'm not Princess Leia.
 Yes
 Yes
 Yes
 You got it.
 No. Look, imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with, but you were free to date whoever you wanted.
 Alright, back to the game.
 We were up to you.
 Okay, let's see. Are you from a TV series?
 Sheldon, he obviously had feelings for her.
 Okay, uh look, you just need to get your mind off it. Do you want to go to the comic book store? Maybe go see a movie?
 I've never been there, have you?
 Okay, then let's do this, lets go to Las Vegas.
 Why not? People do things right now all the time. Why can't we be right now people too. Go home, pack a bag and we'll be right now people. I have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription, but after that we'll go right now.
 Hey, Sheldon, are you coming?
 Great, we'll bring you back a tee-shirt.
 Howard, could I borrow some after shave?
 That is a lot of cologne.
 Come on, let's go.
 That's not an email, that's Leslie's facebook page.
 Alright.
 Okay, uh, if I get lucky I'll take her to my stately manor outside Gotham City, and if you get lucky, I'll sleep on the moon.
 Thanks.
 Dude, check it out. That's laundry for a month!
 Uh, Raj, can I, can I talk to you for a moment.
 Yeah, I really need to talk to you.
 Okay, I hate to break this to you and whatever your jammy is, but, I'm pretty sure she is a prostitute.
 Okay, let me put it this way, in your entire life, how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and asked if you wanted to party.
 Maybe, but I'm guessing it will cost you about $500 an hour to try.
 Oh, Howard's losing it. Check out his latest twitters. “I'm at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss. My life is meaningless, my future is without hope.”
 You think that'd help?
 I don't know, Howard isn't really the family fun kind of guy.
 We're not going to get Wolowitz a hooker.
 Suppose it wouldn't hurt to get an estimate.
 Yeah, hi, listen, m, if you're not busy, well, w-we were thinking you could… well, we were wondering…
 No.
 Okay, great. Um… uh, the thing is, we've got this friend, and he's kind of down in the dumps, and we thought that maybe you could cheer him up.
 I think she knows what I meant.
 Okay, terrific. Um, uh, listen, is there a way that we can do this where he doesn't know that you're a… you know…
 Yes, yeah, exactly, the girlfriend experience.
 Behold?
 Hey, how's it going.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 What were you doing at Penny's?
 Just think. Thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will boldly go where no man has gone before.
 Oh, sure, what's up?
 Yeah, vaguely.
 What about it?
 Oh, too bad. I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, forget it and move on.
 Why the hell not?
 Nobody wants that.
 Uh, oh, gee, my initial reaction is no. You know, let me think about it and get back to you, okay?
 Yeah, or you call me.
 Or nobody calls anyone.
 You know, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj.
 I'm listening.
 Oh, hi.
 Good, good. You?
 Sure.
 Yes.
 About what?
 No, no that's the past. I'm really more of a right now kind of guy. You know, living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future, 'cause, well, that's my job. Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. In conclusion, no, it doesn't bother me.
 Yeah, well I wouldn't say cool, I'd just say, that's Leonardrd!
 About Stuart? Love to.
 Well, uh, first of all, don't underestimate the value of discomfort.
 Well, yeah, Stuart thrives under pressure, that's why he works in a comic book store.
 Oh. It's Stuart.
 He wants to talk about Penny. I don't want to talk about Penny.
 Why would he call me?
 I'm not answering the phone, Sheldon.
 No! There, it went to voice mail.
 No.
 It must be hell inside your head.
 How teeny tiny?
 Well, what are you gonna do?
 So, what do you need us for?
 Good one.
 Hey Stuart.
 Um…
 Yeah, it's a regular Manhattan Project. What's up?
 Yeah, I'm sorry, it's been broken.
 Yeah, that too. Everything's broken.
 All right, well, off the top of my head, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow. I mean, glacial.
 You know, guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to, like, set yourself apart. You know, be a little shy, don't make too much eye contact. And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and, and, and, you know, fear.
 Yeah, like, you're afraid that if you touch her, she'll break.
 Good, good. Well, you kids have fun tonight.
 It wasn't bad advice. It just wasn't particularly helpful.
 I feel terrible.
 I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart's date with Penny.
 Morning.
 Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity… pasta maker. I'm gonna make a coffee run. Do you want any?
 Great. So how'd it go with Stuart last night?
 Yeah. Right. Sure. The thing is, before you guys went out, I spoke to him and…
 Okay… I just… I kind of…
 Comic book store.
 ‘Cause he's upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again, I'm going to kick him in his ovaries.
 Thanks for understanding, Howard.
 Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.
 I think I gave you bad advice about Penny, and I want to apologize.
 It was?
 You're kidding. Never worked for me.
 Wine? I didn't say to give her wine.
 During the kissing? What did you do, sneeze in her mouth? I did that to a girl once.
 Leonardrd?
 Yeah, no, yeah, wow, I'm sorry. That must've been the last thing you wanted to hear.
 No doubt, no doubt. Okay, well, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
 Yeah, how about that? See you soon.
 Howard's space toilet. I'll tell you later.
 I'm sorry, were you talking to me?
 Yes, you did, didn't you?
 What was it doing on the ceiling?
 What?
 Then what was oh, boy?
 There's nothing wrong with the science here.
 Okay, how's that?
 Why?
 Yes, how did we live before Twitter? I guess you'll find out what it is in the morning.
 Yeah, I know the feeling.
 Sheldon, it's two o'clock in the morning.
 Everybody?
 You went to President Seibert's house in the middle of the night?
 You could have waited until morning. I know, look who I'm talking to.
 Hardly a day goes by when I don't think about it.
 Wait a minute. He offered to send you to the North Pole?
 Okay, well, do you want to go?
 Sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death.
 Maybe.
 Easy peasy, I'm doing it right now.
 Well, then don't go.
 All right, then go.
 Sheldon, what are the words I can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?
 How was it resolved?
 I could use the bathroom at 8
 Yeah! Woo-hoo!
 It's not gonna be the same without you.
 Hang on. Let's talk about it. This is a National Science Foundation expedition. I don't know how we can turn it down.
 Howard, this is big science. You could be the engineer who builds the equipment that puts us on the cover of magazines.
 Yes.
 I'm in.
 Hi.
 Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?
 Oh, well, it all happened kind of fast, and we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear and study up on, you know, snow and stuff. Sorry, I was gonna tell you.
 Actually, it would help.
 Yeah.
 Did she seem upset to you?
 No.
 A little bit.
 I mean, I know she's not my girlfriend or anything, but wouldn't you think she'd feel a little bad that I'm going to be gone for the whole summer?
 I can't press any of the buttons with my gloves. Oh, son of a bitch!
 Okay, I can't do this.
 Hang on, I know I don't possess the tools of leadership, but I don't understand why we can't assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside.
 What is it?
 Sheldon, you know I can't eat butter. I'm lactose intolerant.
 Sure, but let's go out here where there's a little less yelling and guilt. What's up?
 Oh, a blanket.
 Oh, wow, cool.
 Bye.
 Sheldon, Sheldon?
 Sheldon, it's me.
 Listen, I don't know if I can go on the expedition.
 I don't think I can go to the North Pole.
 Yeah, that's very comforting.
 Terrific, it's just that I don't think Penny wants me to go.
 Not exactly. But she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this.
 It's a blanket with sleeves.
 Yes, obviously.
 Yes, okay, but I'm gonna be gone for three months. What if she doesn't miss me that long and she meets someone else?
 So, I can't go.
 You really think so?
 It's 7 a.m. I'm sorry it's early, but we're leaving soon, and I needed to talk to you.
 What did you mean when you said you're going to miss me?
 Okay, well, um, what about this? What does this mean?
 All right, fine. What about that really long hug? What did that mean?
 It was at least five Mississippis. A standard hug is two Mississippis tops.
 Glad we cleared that up.
 I guess I'll see you.
 Thank you. Bye.
 Damn it.
 We're out of ice.
 Hey, guys, can I just say something? How about we take a moment to think about where we are right now? This is literally the top of the world. Only a handful of people in all of human history will ever see what we are going to see.
 Dinner's ready!
 Reconstituted Thai food.
 Check.
 Check.
 Uh, oh, sorry.
