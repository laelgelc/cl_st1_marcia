 What are you grinding about?
 Just let it go, Sheldon.
 They slept together, Sherlock.
 She lied.
 Hey.
 No, I'm fine with it.
 What the hell is wrong with you?
 Please. Sheldon would have been before you, and he might not even have genitals.
 What?
 Raj, come on. You fall in love with any girl who smiles at you. A month ago, you were writing poems about his fiancee.
 Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet.
 Do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball?
 I'm not in the mood, Sheldon.
 I don't want to talk to Amy.
 You called my mother?
 What's going on? What do you want?
 That's so nice.
 Well, uh, okay, um, I don't want to get back together with Penny. We tried it, it was crazy, it didn't work, but I can't deal with the fact that she slept with my friend Raj. And then I find out that Raj's sister Priya, who I've been going out with for eight months, is moving back to India. So I'm just completely confused and alone.
 Got any advice?
 Excuse me. You're a world-renowned expert in parenting and child development, and all you've got is buck up?
 Thanks, Mother. I feel much better.
 Hang on, Sheldon. How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?
 You know what, guys, I'm not in the mood for paintball. What do you say we just bag it?
 Sorry, Sheldon, it's just not a good time for playing games.
 Yes, no and no.
 What are you doing?
 Let's get 'em!
 I'd like to propose a toast to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory, Captain Sheldon Cooper.
 Uh, yeah, sure.
 You're leaving?
 Penny, Penny, listen, I hope you're not doing this 'cause of you and me, because I have a girlfriend, and you're a single woman.
 I'm proud of you.
 Oh, uh, Priya's calling in a few minutes on Skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date.
 Fine, whatever. Priya will be having breakfast.
 That doesn't sound like mocking.
 I don't know. Why?
 Listen, I don't want to be rude, but Priya's gonna be calling any minute, so…
 Yes, I've always admired that about you.
 Oh, good.
 A hobby?
 You know, some people might say that it's great that we're trying to make things work long distance. They'd say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you.
 You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this different?
 Of course I like Amy.
 Excuse me, that's Priya.
 Hey, honey.
 Oh, I miss you, too.
 That's three minutes. Should we see what we got?
 Yep.
 Not easy, but we're making it work.
 What?
 There's no junk jiggling. We just talk.
 I can't do that.
 I did it last night, I'm not doing it again.
 I don't want to talk about it. You didn't catch bugs from Penny's chair.
 Sheldon, you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion.
 How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you'd started growing again.
 It's like living with a Chihuahua.
 So, here we are. Back in bed together.
 Okay, so I, I, I guess I'll just jump right in.
 Uh, you're a naughty girl. And, and, uh, I, I want to punish you with my love?
 Not good?
 Okay. Uh, uh, you're not naughty. Uh, you're, you're, you're dirty. You're, you're a, a dirty girl?
 Yeah, yeah. Uh, okay. You're a, you're a, you're a, a dirty, disgusting, revolting girl. Ugh!
 Why don't you just give me five minutes? I'll Google how to do this. I'll call you right back.
 Okay, like usual. Good.
 All rightie. Shirt coming off. Ta-da! Man nipples.
 Yes, ma'am.
 Taking shorts off. There we go. Naked, naked, naked!
 Cool. Uh-oh!
 Oh, damn it!
 No, no! No-no-no! The screen froze. It's probably just buffering, just give it a second.
 So, how are your mom and dad?
 Yeah. Sure, sure.
 Oh! I didn't even think of that. Thanks.
 I don't know about this, Howard.
 I don't think so.
 Oh, hey, babe, I think I figured this thing out.
 No, you listen. You're my woman, and I'm gonna make you feel things you have never felt before.
 That's right, say my name, and beg me for more, 'cause, I'm gonna give it to you.
 Who wants the last dumpling?
 Aren't you going with Sheldon?
 Oh. Well, I have some work to do, so…
 Okay. Wouldn't you be more comfortable at home?
 All righty then. Guess I'll just get started.
 Amy?
 You okay?
 I thought you were reading.
 I, I'm fine.
 What, who told you that?
 Well, you stay as long as you'd like.
 It was good, good. Just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?
 Not really. Is that my yearbook?
 Well, it wasn't spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase, I can tell you that.
 Aw.
 Rough night, Casey Jones?
 What's in the bag?
 Ah, sure. That'd be nice.
 Wouldn't you rather bring Sheldon?
 Ready.
 Amy, this is for you.
 No, thank you. I'm really not much of a dancer.
 I'm sorry. The bride and groom seem happy.
 That sounds like a late night, and I have work in the morning, so…
 Oh, sorry. This wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away.
 I'm not moody. I'm fun.
 Well, hey, I'm just as much fun as you are.
 Okay, fine, what do you suggest?
 Once again, I, I'm really not much of a dancer.
 I just can't figure out what happened. I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out, I put my left leg in, and something just snapped.
 I did have a great time. Thank you for reminding me it's okay to have fun once in a while.
 And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin.
 Well, okay. Again, thank you.
 Want to come in, have a cup of tea?
 Okay. Well, good night.
 Sounds like you had a great night.
 Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.
 Well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. Although, truth be told, my groin's a little worse for wear. Ow! Why did you do that?
 What?
 Hey, how go the wedding plans, Howard?
 See, this is the good thing about having a girlfriend 9,000 miles away. I can spend my nights doing whatever I want.
 Maybe. We enter the dungeon.
 Are you gonna eat that whole pie?
 Oh, God, did you watch Bridget Jones again?
 Now that Howard's getting married, maybe he'll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you.
 Are we ready to order?
 Do you really want that?
 You left out, got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants.
 Yeah, every night for the last month.
 You think she's taking advantage of him?
 Deaf women can't be gold diggers?
 Could you tell us?
 Look, I know they have money. I don't think it's that much.
 Listen, guys, I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but I need to go call Raj's sister, who I love so much. So vastly much.
 Yeah, real big of you.
 It's from Game of Thrones. What do you think?
 What did you have in mind?
 It would be a replica of a movie prop.
 Well, they don't have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?
 Just Bilbo Baggins' sword over there.
 Yeah. It's okay, I guess.
 Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?
 Oh, that's pretty steep.
 Hang on. Can you do any better?
 Slow down. Two hundred.
 Will you shut up?
 Nope. Maybe another time.
 Two hundred.
 Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.
 So?
 Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten.
 See that? I just saved us forty bucks.
 No, it's okay. I'm gonna stab my friend in the chest.
 Thank you.
 I was actually thinking about going.
 No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time.
 Sheldon, can you grab me a water?
 Can you or can't you?
 It never is, is it?
 Got it. Can I have my water?
 Wow.
 Wow, that's amazing!
 I'd like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into space is one we all share, and Howard's making that a reality. We're all very proud of you.
 Thank you.
 Pretty cool about Howard, huh?
 For God's sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff.
 You never stop talking, do you?
Oh!
 Wait, let me see if I got this right. You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?
 I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.
 Going to Wheaton's party is not betraying you.
 I'm going to a party. I'm not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!
 All right, Sheldon, we're going to Wil's. This is your last chance.
 You want to drive?
 Hey, Sheldon?
 No, I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at the party.
 Yes.
 Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him.
 I'm going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon.
 Yeah.
 What are you doing here?
 Can we get autographed dolls?
 Ten.
 Twelve.
 Two for thirty. And you come to my birthday party.
 So what kind of cruise is this you're going on?
 What's Gunning with God? I'm afraid to ask.
 Sheldon, she just got off the plane. She doesn't want to cook.
 All right, that settles it, we're going out. Do you like sushi? There's a great little place down the street.
 Sheldon, you're talking like a crazy person.
 What's the last thing you were ever happy about?
 Uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct.
 Yeah, yeah, that, too.
 It's kind of like the Loch Ness monster. Maybe there's something there, maybe there isn't. We'll probably never know. But sometimes it's fun to creep yourself out thinking about it.
 Uh, yeah, it's Raj's sister. It's kind of tough. She's in India. Also, her parents aren't happy she's dating someone white.
 Please pester her. Please, for me.
 So, Mrs. Cooper, what did you think of the sushi?
 Your son seems to think we need to launch a pre-emptive strike on Burbank.
 Raj, what are you doing?
 We don't say that, either. I'll make you a list.
 You want some Oreos?
 No, regular.
 These are delicious.
 Everything? Aren't you worried about your health?
 I'm just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.
 Sorry. Syrup.
 I hadn't…
 Mrs. Cooper, we say Catholics, not rosary rattlers.
 What are you gonna do? She wanted to see churches.
 Oh, I'm not sure we should.
 Okay. I don't know, it's probably a little late to ask you to make me taller. Oh, um, if you could help out with me and my girlfriend. She's all the way in India. That would be great.
 Here.
 Mrs. Cooper, were we supposed to take that pie out of the oven?
 Hang on. Looks like everyone's a winner.
 Oh. Watch out, Sheldon. This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost!
 That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia.
 Uh, yeah. It's issue number 21. First appearance of Hellboy.
 Sorry.
 Yes, but you'd be using your superpowers for evil.
 Leonard.
 Thanks. You, too. You know, go ahead and take it.
 Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, I guess.
 Sorry, palm's a little sweaty. What's that word?
 Oh, right, your name. That makes more sense than penis.
 No, I don't think I picked her up. Besides, I have a girlfriend.
 How many times are you gonna tell me? What's with you?
 Right.
 More Halloween candy? Didn't you just buy a bunch of it yesterday?
 Will you relax? I'll get it in a minute. Hey, how was work?
 Excuse me. A couple of circulars, nothing important.
 Hang on. You might be from Texas, but I'm from New Jersey.
 Check it out. Jim Lee drew this of me two years ago at Comic Con.
 Well, you know, it's Comic Con. I'm Lion-O from ThunderCats.
 No. But Jessica Alba did rub my furry belly.
 You're kidding. You have your own book?
 Cool. Oh, look. That's you having sex with a guy in the top half of a Chewbacca costume. Comic Con?
 You're very talented. This is really good. Did you do…
 You can have my car.
 Hey, you got a minute?
 Thanks.
 No. Lactose. Gas.
 No. Sulfites. Migraines.
 Okay, we used to go out, right?
 I'm dealing with a situation and it's kind of about my love life, so I know that might be weird for us to talk about, but in this area, as you know, all my other friends are just so stupid.
 So, you're okay talking about this?
 You're sure it's not weird.
 You know what, if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy, then I would be fine with that.
 Okay, uh, here it is. Is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend…
 Come on.
 I met this girl, and she's great. We have a lot in common.
 No. We just made out a little.
 Well, I was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth.
 Here's the thing, I, I'm not one of those guys who sneaks around and sleeps with more than one woman.
 The problem is, I want to be one of those guys.
 Oh, that's not who I am.
 Now, let's not do anything rash. She's really hot.
 Priya and I are in love. I think we could get married someday.
 Now we're getting somewhere.
 Go ask Penny; she'll know what to do.
 What are you doing?
 Hey, well, see you. I'm going out.
 Yeah, me, too. I can't make up my mind.
 No. I'm having a moral crisis.
 Oh, what the hell. I'm supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store, Alice, but I don't know if I should, because I'm going out with Priya, but she's in India.
 Well, they say at the end of your life, you regret the stuff you didn't do more than the stuff that you did, and I'm pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do.
 That actually does help.
 Screw it, I'm going.
 Do you mind? I'm questioning a lot of things in my life right now.
 No.
 Damn it, I can't. I can't, I can't do this.
 No, no, no. I, I can't do this. Believe me, I really want to.
 But I kind of have a girlfriend.
 You're cool with you and me just being friends, right?
 Wait, I don't, which part?
 Oh, no, no, you have it wrong. No. I, I was going to be a jackass, but I stopped myself. I stayed a good guy, so, I'm gonna pass on the sex. But you should know, that's not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness. That's kind of my superpower. I'm, like, Captain Good Guy.
 It's okay. Did the right thing. You idiot!
 Hey, Priya.
 Uh, not so good. We have to talk.
 Okay, uh, here it is. I met this girl and I kissed her, and I feel terrible about it. But it's done, it's never gonna happen again. And I am so, so sorry.
 It is?
 Oh, my God, you are amazing. I mean, I don't deserve you. Wh, what do, what do you mean everybody?
 Uh, kind of?
 No, no, I messed up a little. You messed up a lot.
 Oh yeah, it is, and you won. I, I, I'm, I'm sorry, I have to go. I don't believe this.
 Fine. What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?
 Hey, Amy, what brings you to our neck of the woods?
 This time, it's your fault.
 Amy, how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me?
 No, it's not gonna do it.
 Leonard's coming down the home stretch! Come on, horsey, you can do this! Damn. Come on, thigh muscles, you can do this! Yes! First place. I would have been a great jockey if I weren't too tall. And scared of horses. Sheldon, you're up.
 Come on, it's your turn. We said we'd get more fresh air.
 Did you try calling her on the telephone?
 If you're worried, we can go over there and see if she's all right.
 I don't think Amy was eaten by a bobcat.
 You do?
 Forget about the bobcat.
 Uh, she's your friend. Step up.
Amy. Amy. Amy. Bye.
 I'm single, I don't need this crap.
 For all those girls out there looking for the Indian Monopoly man?
 Why do I have to talk to Penny? She's not my girlfriend.
 Moo-shu is Penny.
 Oh, he was up late last night, so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed.
 Yeah, but now he's gonna be up at dawn and want to play.
 Her feelings got hurt because you guys went dress shopping without her.
 Hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?
 What's going on?
 Really? Amy?
 Hi, Amy.
 Cuddles?
 Amy, what are you doing here?
 Yeah, but why didn't you go back to your apartment?
 Maybe we should get you home.
 Yeah, Sheldon, what would it take?
 Okay. Come on. Upsy-daisy.
 Oh, hey. You work the lunch shift?
 Not really.
 Star Wars on Blu-ray.
 Not on Blu-ray. Only twice on Blu-ray.
 I know, it's high-resolution sadness.
 Really? Do we do that?
 You know, we haven't spent time alone together since we broke up.
 Sounds like most of my dates.
 Well, he's smart and crazy enough, he may have actually created a monster.
 What the hell is going on?
 Movies, yes.
 Sheldon, just ignore him.
 The bird's still there?
 I don't know. Scree-scree.
 Sorry. Do you think I'm overdressed?
 I'm going to the movies with Penny. I don't want her to think that I think it's a date.
 No, but she might think I think it's a date even though I don't.
 Are we overthinking this?
 You're right. I'm fine. I'm wearing this.
 Too casual?
 Oh, yeah, sure. There's also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in South America.
 Can't argue with that. I'll get the tickets.
 Actually, you know what? I think it's about time I pick a movie we see.
 No. You always picked, and it was always the same. An hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes love was here all along.
 I hate those movies.
 Yes, I do. The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them, and I wanted to have sex. To this day, I can't see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused.
 All the time.
 Does this sound familiar? I'd love to go shoe shopping with you. Hiking? It's great. It's two a.m., of course I want to go to Korea Town and sing karaoke with your friends. Who wouldn't?
 Really? You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?
 See? Now, that's the great thing. We're out as friends. This is not a date. Sex is off the table. So, let's go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is. Sorry. Spoiler alert.
 Thanks. Tickets are eleven bucks. Not a date.
 Come on, you enjoyed the movie. I saw you tearing up when the village got flooded, and everyone had to relocate.
 I'm going to get some fries. You want anything?
 Are you sure? Because you always say no, and then you eat half my fries.
 No, I love them. I save them for the end, but they're gone because you ate them. And why did I let you eat them?
 Exactly. But this is not a date. So I ask again, would you like anything?
 Great. That'll be five dollars. I am having the best time. I'm so glad you suggested we do this.
 Uh, right.
 You're kidding me. Uh, can I see you for a sec over here?
 I know what you're doing.
 You're going out of your way to talk to that guy because I said we weren't on a date.
 Come on, he's not that cute.
 I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.
 If that's so, what if I start talking to a girl?
 I'm serious. I'll do it.
 They're in a group. I'm scared.
 Um, let's see. Hiking. Karaoke in Koreatown. Any Jennifer Aniston movie.
 No, it's fine. You can ditch away.
 It's cool. Go back to Kevin.
 Interesting. So now that he's gone, you want to hang out with me.
 Yep.
 Don't worry about it. You know, there's some guys over there. You should go talk to them.
 That's kind of between me and…
 Laura.
 Hey, pal. You didn't see me telling Kevin that you thought cold wars were only fought in winter.
 When you were telling Kevin about your acting career, did you mention your long-running role as Waitress in a local production of The Cheesecake Factory?
 Oh, yeah? Spell asthma.
 Maybe I'm not done hanging out with… You're right, it's getting late.
 Okay. So, we went out, saw a movie, met some nice people, said horrible things about each other in public, all in all, a pretty magical night.
 I know, I, I, I crossed a line. And I'm sorry. No, no, no, hang on. I really mean it. And it's not like when we were going out, I'd just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed. This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table I'm sorry.
 Just to be clear, sex is off the table, right?
 Maybe we're not ready to hang out as friends.
 Really?
 Well, then, I'm putting sex back on the table. What do you think about that?
 You do? Because if that's what you like, I can be that guy. I swear, I'll be anything you want me to be.
 I am such an asthmatic dumbass. I had a weird night.
 It's probably for the best. For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets.
 Well, ho-hold on. What if the wizard casts a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid's cowboy hat?
 Couple of weirdos. Why?
 Sure. I guess.
 I hate all of you and myself. Three.
 Hey, can I talk to you about something? It's a little awkward.
 Yeah, that's not it. Stuart's kind of interested in Amy.
 No. He wanted me to find out if you'd have a problem with him asking her out.
 You know what? Never mind. I'm going to tell him it's okay to ask her out.
 All right, but just for the record, I checked in with you to see how you'd feel about it.
 I am not washed-up.
 Really?
 I want to return this Wild West and Witches Ka'a expansion pack.
 Sure, sure. Uh, when will Stuart be back?
 You okay?
 A tribe of Abra-Comanches.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 We should go easy on him. Amy's out with Stuart tonight.
 Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.
 It's you.
 Oh come on, no! We just bought the regular pack.
 With a hologram? Nice. Hey, do you see this?
 You've got to be kidding me. You friended Stuart on Facebook?
 Sheldon, why don't you just acknowledge that you have feelings for Amy and you don't want her going out with other men?
 That's all of us. Can I use the laptop?
 I have to buy that stupid collector's tin.
 Yeah, it's “Penny already eats our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi.” No spaces.
 You want to hear something weird?
 What are you talking about?
 Yeah, because I have something weird to tell her.
 There's this guy, Jimmy Speckerman, who used to torment me in high school. He sent me a message through Facebook. He's in town and wants to have drinks.
 Just do it, 'cause he's not gonna let it go.
 I don't know.
 No, that was a different guy.
 No, that was a different, different guy.
 No.
 No, but, actually, that was this guy's sister.
 I don't know.
 I told you. That was a different guy.
 It's two a.m. What are you doing up?
 Sure. You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.
 Thanks.
 I didn't have clams.
 It's this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I can't decide if I should agree to see him or not. Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him, he made me floss with my own shoelaces.
 You know what? I am tired of living in fear of this guy. I'm gonna go see him and finally say all the things I should have said in high school. You know, pick on someone your own size, you did not have sex with my mother, and yes, I do know why I'm hitting myself.”
 No.
 You know, I can really do this by myself.
 No, you're not. You're here to see if I get my underwear pulled over my head.
 You bet. I am going to make him apologize for all the crap he pulled on me in school.
 Scrotum.
 Uh, stapled.
 Oh, hi.
 Yeah. You, too. Uh, Jimmy, this is Sheldon and Raj and Howard.
 I'm doing okay, I guess.
 The Newcomb medal.
 Oh, I can't take all the credit. You helped a lot.
 Jimmy, I'm kind of curious why you wanted to see me.
 What's the idea?
 Right.
 I don't think something like that's even possible.
 Sheldon, I got this.
 Sheldon.
 I think what he's trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit.
 14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind.
 Nancy. You called me Nancy for three years.
 It wasn't fun for me.
 Come on, guys.
 Hey, for the record, Jimmy wasn't the reason I wet the bed. That one has my mother written all over it.
 Here's your cocoa.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 You got one for good luck. I'll get it.
 What are you doing here?
 Laxative.
 Really?
 Uh, yeah. Sure, I guess.
 Well, yeah, thanks, Jimmy.
 Are you okay to drive?
 No, no, no, come on in. I'll make you a cup of coffee.
 No.
 Sheldon, we can't let him drive.
 You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard.
 Yeah, just back there.
 Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.
 Yeah.
 What was I supposed to do? He needed a place to sleep it off.
 Morning, Jimmy.
 Yeah, you did. So, uh, listen, it was great to see you again. And , and, and thanks for the apology.
 For all the crappy stuff you did to me in high school.
 That's my French toast.
 I might kill him right now.
 Okay, Jimmy, it's time for you to go.
 No, you're done. I want you out of my apartment right now.
 I'm not afraid of you any more, Jimmy. Now get out! Uh-oh.
 Yeah, I feel pretty good about myself. You think we can outrun him?
 Mm-hmm. Yep. I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood.
 Sheldon, he's just practising for his cousin's birthday party.
 Sheldon, he's just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids. I really don't think they're gonna end up liking the Green Lantern movie.
 Next time, you should open with that.
 Oh, a little Red Dead Redemption, huh?
 How come you're not doing a mission? You're just wandering around.
 Some people go outside and do that.
 You want to talk about it?
 You know digital alcohol is never a solution. What's going on?
 Glad I was sitting down for that. Did you and Amy get in a fight?
 No, I can't. I'm playing Grand Theft Auto later. Look, I'm no expert in women.
 That's not necessary when someone's trying to help you.
 Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change.
 I don't know what to tell you. Buy her something.
 Well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture.
 Glad I could help.
 There you go, Howard. Sounds like Raj'll have your babies, problem solved.
 What are you gonna do?
 You know, there's no guarantee even if you have kids that you're going to like them.
 It's right off the dust jacket of my mom's last book.
 Look, Howard, I'd say there's a lot of fish in the sea, but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years. Do not throw her back.
 You feel like trying something new for dinner? Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?
 Okay, let's talk about that.
 We all do. Now, how about dinner?
 Excuse me.
 Excuse me, Amy. Penny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?
 No, I mean just you and me.
 Not like a date, a date.
 Okay, how do I look?
 What are you talking about?
 I didn't defile your sister, we had a relationship.
 Oh, boy, do I?
 Where on earth did you get that from?
 That doesn't make it true.
 See you later.
 So, do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with?
 Yeah, that sounds right.
 Hey, how about if we pretend we're actually on a first date? See how that goes.
 So, Polly, tell me about yourself.
 Oh, sorry, yeah. Awkward.
 Uh, let's see. Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech, most of my research is with high-powered lasers, and, oh, I've just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles.
 Oh, God, no. The money's pretty good. And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal.
 Not some kind of nerd, I am the king of the nerds.
 Uh, it means if anyone displeases me, I don't help them set up their printer.
 Good. Remember that when I take my shirt off.
 Me, too. So what do you think? Are we gonna get back together?
 I'm sorry, what did I say?
 Oh, God.
 You said always. You'll always have feelings for me.
 So, that sounds more like something you'd say if you didn't want a relationship with someone. This isn't working out, but I'll always have feelings for you. I'm sorry I slept with your best friend, but I'll always have feelings for you. Here's the thing, Lisa, I'm into dudes now, but I'll always have feelings for you.
 I have feelings for you.
 No, it's not. Always made it worse.
 No, I'm not.
 Ah now th-th-there you go. Always made it worse.
 Well, I don't know how you have a relationship without talking.
 Wait, if you guys didn't talk, what did you… never mind, stupid question.
 You're thirty years old and you live with your mother.
 What does she want from me now? What's up?
 I don't understand.
 Okay, but earlier it seemed like…
 Even during? ‘Cause sometimes I have questions.
 Yeah, except for when I got the foot cramp.
 Well, there was a lot at stake.
 Well, I want to go get my asthma inhaler, but it might ruin the moment. Just, just help me out here. How does a miserable date end in sex?
 Well, I'm a pretty smart guy, and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply, so give it a go.
 Why? What are you afraid of?
 What if I dump you?
 Well, how about if we don't think about this as a relationship? It could be more like a new version of software. Penny and Leonard 2.0. We can test it internally, shake out the bugs, and if we both feel it's solid, then we'll roll it out to the public.
 Exactly. We pretend like our date went badly.
 And we let them think that we decided to just be friends and that everything's cool.
 I can't believe you kept this.
 That is so sweet. In 25 to 30 minutes I'm gonna show you how much this means to me.
 Yeah, hi, hi. How's it going?
 Well, uh, uh, what are you doing up?
 Yeah, well, so was I.
 Obviously, when I saw that you were in ours, I went and used another one.
 The, the gas station across the street.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did.
 What?
 What?
 No.
 I don't want beef jerky.
 Fine.
 We are next to a Suburu with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.
 Well, hey, we're grown-ups. We can still be friends.
 Yeah, it's all good. We-We'll always have feelings for each other.
 See, she knew what always meant.
 I'm just making a point.
 Oh, that is not true.
 Well…
 Unbelievable.
 Well, I was trying to act like we weren't seeing each other. That was the plan, right?
 You know what? I don't have to stand here and take this crap.
 Isn't sex after fighting kind of what we do now?
 What are we doing?
 Every scenario I play out for you and me ends badly.
 What? Yeah.
 I don't know, he was pretty badass on Heroes.
 Hang on. Penny, do you have plans for dinner?
 No, I mean just you and me.
 Yes, and I think we should go anyway.
 Excuse me, sorry, excuse me.
 Sorry. I'm having dinner with Penny. I have to get out of here.
 Me, too, I missed you.
 Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great. Have you ever tried it?
 Oh, I can take it slow. Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school, Karen Berberick? To this day she doesn't know we were going out. Made it easier on her when I broke things off.
 How about this, are you familiar with the typical development for computer software?
 Before an application is released, they give it a trial run. W-We could do that. And if we hit a rough spot, instead of getting mad, just say, hey, we found a bug, and we report it so it can be fixed.
 Well, technically, this would be an alpha test. A beta test requires people that weren't involved in the development of the appli…
 No, you should. Absolutely. That was me being pedantic. That's our first bug. You reported it. I can fix that. See? This is good.
 Great. You keep a list, I'll keep a list. At some point, we'll exchange.
 Night. Attaboy, Hofstadter. Nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies. Hey, I'm back.
 Um, I'm not sure, but I think the right answer here is no.
 Even Doctor Who?
 Okay, bug report taken. Next time I will have a better plan for our evening's activity.
 Oh, wait, here, almost forgot. Here.
 My bug report to you.
 It's colour coded.
 Uh, red means fix right away. Yellow is eh, whenever you get a chance. And green is I could probably learn to live with it. There's a key down here at the bottom. It's neat, huh?
 So, have a good night.
 Look at that. Some day, we will tell future generations that dating used to be hard.
 Hey. You ready to go?
 Can you finish it later?
 Great. Good. Great. What are you reading?
 They kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that, don't they? All right. Look, just remember how this works. We don't get mad about these things. Uh, speaking of which, I've addressed your bug report on my date planning. Got a really fun evening for you. It's kind of a surprise.
 Thank you.
 All right, fair enough. I certainly can be quieter when we kiss. I thought it was an expression of passion, but if it's coming across as juicy and weird, who wants that? Uh, uh, I'm sorry, can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are stupid? Nah, never mind, it's right here.
 I called your dad. I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.
 You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?
 Right. Sorry, sorry.
 Right. Sorry.
 I play a lot of Grand Theft Auto. I think I know how to handle a gat.
 So, I've got a gunshot wound. That's pretty badass.
 Hello? They gave me a Band-Aid. Hospitals do not issue Band-Aids unless it is medically necessary. That is the law.
 Thank you for hiding my Star Wars socks at the emergency room. Is it a good time to evaluate the beta test and see where we stand?
 So, are we still taking things slow? Because a gunshot wound today, last week, I slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer. We don't know how much time I have.
 Aaargh. What the hell?
 Oh, no, come on!
 I have to get a lock for my door.
 Sheldon, Canada is not going to invade California.
 Fine.
 Oh, fun. I get to spend another night in front of our apartment dressed like one of the Village People.
 I don't know, what am I doing?
 Aah!
 Because the cafeteria doesn't offer little packets of methamphetamine.
 Uh-huh.
 You know what, I'm so tired I can't even think straight. I'm going home. Will one of you guys give this nutbag a ride back later?
 Oh, can't you take the bus to the dentist?
 Whatever, Sheldon. I'm exhausted. I'm not taking you to the dentist.
 You know what, I am sick of the roommate agreement. It's ridiculous. I'm your roommate, not your chauffeur. You know, I had better things to do yesterday than drive you all the way to the good model train store in Garden Grove because the one in Pasadena has gotten too big for its britches.
 I don't care. I'm done.
 I don't know what that is, but if it means I can go home and sleep, then yes.
 Where do I sign?
 There. Done.
 I'm gonna go home and take a nap.
 ‘Sup?
 That's not bad, Howard “Rocket Man” Wolowitz.
 Once I tried carrying around a Duncan yo-yo, hoping the other kids would start calling me Duncan.
 No, they ended up calling me Sock Mouth. Because they took away my yo-yo and stuffed their socks in my mouth.
 ‘Sup?
 Hey, did you ever make it to the dentist?
 All right, Sheldon, if you need me to take you to the dentist, I will take you to the dentist.
 Absolutely. If you admit that you're a 30-year-old man who's incapable of functioning on his own.
 Why is that good?
 What happened to all your glow-in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the floor?
 It's just a blackout, I'm sure the power will be back on soon.
 You call that a glow stick? That is a glow stick. Come on, let's go.
 To wine and bubble wrap. And to not having to watch Sheldon demonstrate his reverse osmosis machine that converts urine into drinking water.
 I thought because our relationship's in a beta test, you wanted to take things slow.
 I can go so slow it'll be like there's a snail in your mouth.
 Since when don't you knock? It's like the only good thing about you.
 Fine, what is it?
 S'mores, huh? Good for you.
 No, thanks. I'm good.
 No, don't aw him. He brought this all on himself.
 No, he's crazy. Sometimes crazy looks like sad so it'll suck you back in.
 Fine. But mark my words, this frustrating, bogus teenage make-out session is not over.
 I thought you said candles were dangerous.
 Listen, Sheldon, this is stupid. I don't see why we can't be friends. And I'm willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff. I just don't want to do it because of some silly roommate agreement.
 That we go back to the way things were. But when I do something for you, you show a little appreciation.
 You say thank you.
 It's not crazy.
 I kind of like the sound of that.
 So, do I get breakfast in bed on Leonard's Day?
 Can I sit in your spot?
 Can I control the thermostat?
 Do I get a card?
 Really. Who do you think did that, Sheldon?
 Five.
 Positive.
 It's not funny. That mistake got published.
 Doesn't look happy, so I'm guessing he wants to talk to Sheldon.
 Told ya.
 That tonight's gonna be a good night, and tonight's gonna be a good night, and tonight's gonna be a good, good night! Tonight's the night, uh, uh, let's live it up, uh, I got my money, let's spend it up…
 What the hell are you doing?
 What are you doing hiding back there?
 Lobster traps?
 What are you going to do when you get to the university? People are going to recognize you.
 Fine. Just get back under your blanket, and I'll drive you there.
 Fine.
 Sheldon, there are a million great vacations you could take. What about Hawaii?
 Sheldon, everybody takes vacations.
 Hey.
 Is that your laundry? You only have, like, six things in there.
 It doesn't matter what I say, you're gonna tell me anyway.
 Wow. That's rough.
 Absolutely not. If I'm gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you're on location cheating on me with Ryan Gosling, then Leonard gots to get paid. So, you think about us getting married?
 Joke all you want, but you think about it.
 Good luck catching a man with that attitude.
 Where's Howard?
 I'm sorry. So, listen, I heard something about him. Can you keep it between us?
 Bernadette wants to get a pre-nup.
 I never know what to do in these situations. Should I give him a heads-up?
 Hey, Howard, I need to tell you something.
 Uh, listen, I heard that Bernadette's thinking about asking you for a pre-nup.
 What are you gonna do?
Good. That's a healthy attitude.
 What choice did the university have? He snapped. It happens to theoretical physicists all the time.
 Can't be very long.
 Yeah.
 You just called dibs.
 Professor Rothman.
 Good evening.
 What's he doing here?
 Hail.
 H-h-h-hang on, Howard. Barry, how good of a shot are you?
 It's gonna be hard to find something you're both equally good at.
 All right, this is one-on-one. First person to five wins the office. Any questions? Yes, Sheldon?
 Balls in the basket. 
 You know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us?
 I get it.
 No, he didn't. Nothing that's happening here is being done on purpose. Okay, uh, forget one-on-one. Let's try a free throw contest. First person who makes a basket wins the office.
 No. No, I'm not.
 All right, we gave it 45 minutes. It's no longer funny. Let's try something else.
 Uh, on the count of three, both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can. The highest bounce wins the office.
 All right, that's enough trash talk. One, two, three.
 Congratulations, Sheldon. You win office.
 What are you doing?
 Why is there a hole here?
 Sheldon, relax.
 If you're not happy, why don't you just let Kripke have the office?
 What happened?
 Why would you do that?
 Hang in there. I'll be right back.
 I'm just gonna run to the store and get a few things. I'll pick you up when you're done.
 Excuse us for a second. Sheldon, it's okay, he can do it. He's a barber.
 What are you talking about?
 There's no such thing as haircut records.
 Have you ever seen them?
 Sheldon, you're a grown man, he's a professional, and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946. Just sit down and let him do it.
 When you tell this story later, the word we usually use is quirky.
 Sure. What are you doing?
 Sheldon, you are one day late for your haircut.
 So, what kind of things are they…  will you stop that?
 Sheldon, be nice.
 Hmm.
 You know, I think this is a good stopping point. Uh, it's your first real game. I threw a lot of information at you.
 Like I said, complicated game.
 Did you have fun? Because if you had fun, then you are, you are a winner. Now that's, that-that's what chess is all about.
 Hey.
 I don't know. Between you playing chess like Bobby Fischer and Sheldon being okay with you in his spot, I'm guessing someone went back in time, stepped on a bug, and changed the course of human events.
 Oh, uh, he's crazy.
 Good. I'm taking that disgusting chart off the fridge.
 I think this could be good for you. Maybe it's time for you to shake things up a bit.
 Great. What are you going to do first?
 I got to tell you, I'm a little worried about him.
 Don't let this be Sheldon playing bongos. Please don't let this be Sheldon playing bongos.
 Sheldon, it's three o'clock in the morning.
 I was sleeping.
 No, he doesn't.
 Stop! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop it!
 Oh, hi, Penny, guess what? Sheldon got bongos.
 Richard Feynman was a famous physicist.
 Sheldon, go to bed. You have work in the morning.
 W-w-wuh, no, no, hang on,uh, uh, roommate agreement. No hootenannies, sing-a-longs, or barbershop quartets after ten p.m.
 Poor guy. He must have been exhausted. Sheldon like to sleep while Leonard play the bongo!
 No, it was called for.
 I'm sorry, duh, what?
 What's this about Sheldon seeing you naked?
 Oh, I don't know. I kind of promised myself I'd get off the computer, be more physically active. Get some exercise.
 Good point, I'm in.
 You mean, are you talking gaming marathon?
 It would be like our World Of Warcraft a few years ago when the neighbours called the cops on us.
 All right, let's do it.
 Hey, Sheldon, clear your weekend. Starting Saturday morning, Star Wars< marathon
 We are going to play the online game.
 We'll miss you, Sheldon.
 I'd make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems if I wasn't in shock that Sheldon has girl problems.
 That's what your father used to say?
 Hey, listen, I kind of made plans with the guys this weekend, but then I wondered, because we're in this relationship-beta-test, if I should have asked you first. Then I thought if I did check with you first, you'd think that I was taking things to seriously. And then, then I got a nosebleed.
 Oh. I guess I was hoping for a different reaction, but okay.
 I don't know, maybe that you'd be a little upset, and then you'd realize that I'm a stallion that has to run free. And that would turn you on a little.
 Do you mind if I spend the weekend playing video games with the guys?
 Ay papi? What is that?
 Oh. So you chose that when you become turned on, you turn into Speedy Gonzalez?
 Uh-uh.
 Keep an eye on those expiration dates, I've been burned more than once.
 You pick up a Y chromosome while you were there? You might be short one.
 Well, we're always the good guys. In D&D, we're lawful good, in City Of Heroes, we're the heroes, in Grand Theft Auto, we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat.
 Uh, if it's yoghurt that helps ladies poop, I think Raj beat you to it.
 Uh, it is, but I think you might've waited too long for it to be funny. I was wrong, it's still funny.
 Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail.
 All right, I think we got them all. Let's divide up the loot.
 Mmm, you liked Professor Guyster's wedding.
 Who you bringing?
 Yeah, I'm glad.
 Sure, what's up?
 I'm sorry, you are our resident cut-up?
 Prove it.
 Who's there?
 Interrupting physi…
 Where did you get that?
 You went to the comic-book store by yourself?
 Wow. No, it's great. Also, uh, mint in box.
 Awesome!
 Ah!
 They're Collectables.
No!
 Once you open the box it loses its value.
 What?
 Really? I don't even notice any more.
 Well I told you, you don't, it's mint in box.
 You know, you're right. I mean, it's from you, I'm never going to sell it. I'm opening it.
 It's broken.
 Absolutely.
 Why would you open mine?
 Well, you should talk to Stuart.
 Okay, that I believe.
 So, is that one mine.
 Well, hand it over so I can open it.
 And that's a lie, right?
 You're kidding.
 That's amazing. You'll be like his pit crew. A word of caution, I would not do your Stephen Hawking impression in front of him.
 Yeah, he worships Hawking.
 Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking. It'll look so nice next to the ones he's already got from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.
 Like it was ten hours ago. What about it?
 Really?
 Still going to introduce him?
 So, come on, how was the first day with Hawking?
 Raj, you're our group historian. Has Sheldon ever begged before?
 What if he doesn't?
 You do realize you own his ass right now.
 What are these?
 It's nicer than anything he's ever said to me. I'd take it and run.
 Give it a second.
 Horse, but mostly just for the height. A little bit for the genital girth.
 Also instead of just living in your mother's house, you could actually live inside her body.
 Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.
 No, he didn't.
 Good for you, Howard. I'm proud of you. And still, you're the first one of us to get married. We have to do something special.
 Look at that, in 30 seconds, we went from hiring women to being them.
 Yeah, just going to a restaurant, get some steaks and scotch. Nothing to worry about.
 Well, I don't know. It's a bachelor party. There could be strippers. Wouldn't that make you a little jealous?
 Hey, I am a young man in his sexual prime. Under the right conditions, I-I-I am capable of just, really crazy stuff.
 Oh, come on, that's got to count. There was a really strong undertow, we could have died.
 Oh, I will. There is no telling what might happen.
 You know, there's nothing wrong helping some woman's kid get through their S.A.T.'s.
 Hey, I got to hand it to Raj, he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party.
 Are you drinking whisky?
 Whoa, it's a little early to start dropping J-bombs, don't you think?
 Oh, hey, Wil. Nice of you to make it out tonight for Howard.
 Oh, yeah, no worries.
 Oh, all right.
 Yeah, sure.
 Oh.
 Wow, that's very nice.
 For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny.
 Hear! Hear!
 Sheldon…
 So, Howard Wolowitz tying the knot. Leaving his crazy bachelor days behind. He was a wild one. Well, I guess we all kind of were. I remember this one time, I was with this girl at the beach. We were in the ocean and we started making out. I know, it was crazy. I wasn't even wearing my Aquasocks. Then…
 Right. To Howard.
 I totally had sex in the ocean.
 Hear, hear.
 Actually, you did do one of them together.
 Well, Howard, I don't know much about women.
 No, uh, that, that's it. I don't know much about women. Raj, you got anything?
 Hello.
 I'm gonna have sex with you right here, right now, on that washing machine.
 Come on, please.
 Folding a sheet in my underwear, still pretty crazy.
 Do you think maybe it's tight because you're wearing long underwear?
 All right, let me rephrase the question. Why are you wearing long underwear?
 No, it should be
 I'm sorry, Howard, but I got to tell you, I'm a little relieved you're not going.
 Come on, you were gonna go up in a rocket designed in the 1960s by the Russians.
 When was the last time you were at Best Buy and you heard someone say, ooh, check out this Blu-ray player, it must be good, it was built in Russia”?
 You must be burning up.
 He keeps emergency Purell in the car.
 Before I come in, you should know, I have gas.
 Check it out. It's the gas I use in my free-electron laser to support high voltages. But it also has an interesting secondary use. Here. Breathe this in.
 Just try it.
 You're a mean one Mr. Grinch.
 I have never been more attracted to a woman who sounds like a man in my life.
 Mm-hmm.
 Oh, great.
 And I promise, after waiting four months, fast is what you're gonna get.
 So we won't let it get weird.
 What about Cookies!
 I'm sorry. I did, I crossed a line. I didn't mean to!
 I don't know, it just came out. People say weird things during sex all the time.
 It was the heat of the moment.
 I'm sorry. Just, just give me another chance.
 Again, I'm sorry. You know, with Howard and Bernadette getting married, I got caught up in a little wedding fever. I take it back.
 Okay, at some point, we'll look back and this is going to be a funny story. Why don't we just start doing that now?
 No. Hey, do you remember that time when I proposed to you in bed? And you were all, like, what are you doing? That was so funny. So funny.
 Give it a minute. Is that a little smile I see there? I should go.
 Sheldon, knight takes bishop. You all right?
 Are you? You left your queen exposed from above, you trapped your knight in the corner, and you keep sighing and saying, why me?
 We got you that book last year. Wasn't everything in there?
 Well, if it makes you feel any better, I screwed things up pretty good with Penny.
 I guess we are. So, what's going on?
 I'm sorry, that must be very difficult for you.
 Shame on her.
 She's good.
 You mean, like in bed or in the shower?
 Well, if you had a physical relationship, I'd say propose during sex. Turns out that's a real mood killer.
 Yeah.
 Pretty much.
 Hey. Off to work?
 Have a nice night.
 Penny, just, wait. I've been thinking about what I said when we were in bed the other night.
 I noticed you never answered me.
 Uh, follow-up. Are we still dating?
 Is it still weird 'cause I proposed?
 I have a couple more quick questions. Do you want to call me from the car?
 I played that pretty well. 
 What are you doing?
 Sheldon, what channel is NASA TV?
 There's Howard's rocket, live from Kazakhstan.
 That's so great.
 Come on, Sheldon, it'll be fun.
 Where'd you get a beer?
 I don't want to talk about it.
 She said no, can we drop it now?
 What, I can't propose? I can't talk to my friends? Is there anything else I'm not allowed to do?
 Will you shut up?
 That's so cool.
 How about our roof?
 Oh, wow.
 I doubt he'll ask you to kill a man.
 Come on, Raj, we're ready to start.
 Hmm.
 No.
 Hey, I didn't say it.
 Thank you, Amy. Very touching. Howard and Bernadette, you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other. And that's the strongest kind of love because at its core, it has kindness, patience, and respect. Qualities that are hard to find in people these days.
 By the power vested in us, by the state of California…
 We now pronounce you husband and wife.
 No, come on in. Hurry.
 This is it.
