 Hey. Is the food here? Ooh. What's that?
 Ah, cool.
 Oh, does that come up much on the space station?
 All right. Pass the soy sauce.
 Oh, it's not bad. Kind of hungry.
 Really? They're going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger?
 Oh ha-ha, oh. That's amazing.
 Does NASA know you're using that thing as a napkin holder?
 You stole it?
 Who's Amy?
 Sheldon has a girlfriend?
 How long has this been going on?
 Are you telling me, for the past four months I have been asking you what's new and you never thought to go with Sheldon has a girlfriend?
 Ah, du-du-du-du-du. How did they meet?
 Oh, my God! Sheldon and Amy.
 Shamy. I am so digging the Shamy.
 Okay, well, what do you communicate about?
 Thank you.
 Okay, I have a question.
 You don't even like people touching you. How are you going to have sex?
 Oh, honey, did your mom not have the talk with you? You know, when your private parts started growing?
 Oh, God.
 Look, Sheldon, before you race off to the fertility clinic, you might want to think about, uh gee, I don't know, maybe actually spending some time with her.
 Yeah.
 Why not?
 Okay, look, don't think of it as dating a girlfriend. Think of it as, uh, getting to know the future mother of your child.
 Probably not.
 You do realize I stand on the other side of the door waiting for you to finish knocking three times.
 Yeah, my point is it's a waste of time.
 What do you want?
 Oh, that's great. Have fun.
 What?
 Well, go ask Leonarard.
 Leonard said cockamamie?
 Okay, fine. When's the date?
 Now?
 Sheldon, did it ever occur to you that I might have other plans?
 Well, no, not per se, but…
 Let me get my cockamamie keys.
 You're welcome.
 Sheldon.
 Can I ask you a question?
 Yeah. Well, my question is, and I'm pretty sure I know the answer, is this your first date?
 No.
 Okay. Well, then, there's a couple of things you should probably know.
 My point is, I know more about dating than you, and if you were as smart as you think you are, you would listen to me.
 Fair point.
 So, um, Amy, Sheldon tells me you're a neuro something-or-other.
 Yeah, it's okay.
 Um, what is that scent you're wearing? It smells great.
 Ah. Well, your hair looks very nice.
 No, no, I was just giving you a compliment.
 Guys, how 'bout some music?
 Okay. Uncomfortable silence it is. Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy what it was like for you growing up in Texas?
 Well, why don't you tell her?
 Any follow up, Amy?
 I myself grew up in Nebraska. Small town outside of Omaha. You know, nice place, mostly family farms, a few meth labs.
 I don't know. I was just trying something.
 Hey, here's another possible topic of conversation. This is a big night for Sheldon. Right, Sheldon?
 No, no. My point is, uh, tonight is Sheldon's first official date. Discuss.
 So, um, Amy, what about you? Do you date much?
 Uh, yeah, I wouldn't say many. A few. What's?
 What? Where did you get 171 men?
 Whoa, wait, wait, wait. I did not start dating at 15.
 14.
 No.
 Oh.
 Okay, Sheldon, I think you've made your point.
 Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong. That is not even close to the real number. I'm gonna need a drink over here.
 No! No! No. Let's just all finish our dinners, okay?
 I did not have sex with 31 guys.
 And that is?
 You're still on that?
 Okay, you know what? I'm gonna come at this in a whole new way. Sheldon, if you try to make a baby with Amy in a petri dish, I'm gonna tell your mother on you.
 Really? Your deeply religious born-again Christian mother wants a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock?
 If I'd thought of that in the first place, I could've saved myself this whole night.
 What?
 Oh, you wanted me to pay.
 No, no, no, no. You're right. We're not going out anymore, I should pay for myself. What?
 Yeah, but you wouldn't be able to talk to yourself. I'm a little low on cash.
 Nothing.
 I'm cute. I get by.
 Okay.
 But it's Thursday. Thursday's pizza night.
 For what?
 Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
 Wait. CyBernadetteetics is robot stuff, right?
 So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?
 Okay, here's my question. Didn't you already do that?
 Wait. Honey,have you ever run before?
 No, it won't. Um, how does he know I jog?
 Oh, my God, that is so creepy!
 Coming, coming. Hey, nice knees.
 Oh. And the Flash shirt is what? Because you're gonna run really fast?
 I don't have one.
 Don't have one.
 Uh, no.
 No. I just run till I'm hungry, then I stop for a bear claw.
 It's good to stretch your muscles before you run.
 All right, let's start with a toe touch. Okay, you do it.
 Oh. Wow. Good job. Okay, um, can you do this?
 Okay, let's just warm up on the run.
 Okay, let's go.
 Oh, my God, are you okay?
 Oh, let me help you up.
 Oh, Sheldon!
 Thanks.
 Hey, what's my share?
 Okay, can I get you after Friday when I get paid?
 What am I up to now?
 What now?
 It's not free, I'm gonna pay him back. Shut up!
 Yeah, to be honest, I don't see much difference.
 So, either one of you weirdos want to buy my underwear? Only fourteen hundred bucks.
 Oh, great. Hi, I'm Penny, I'll be your waitress.
 I'd rather people not know I have any prior connection to you whatsoever.
 Sheldon, I'm not waiting on you.
 Because you're not here.
 Yeah, I know who he is. I watch Dancing with the Stars.
 You know, there's an Olive Garden down the street. You guys should try it sometime.
 What up, Sheldon-Bot?
 What do you want me to do?
 Really, you want me to sing Soft Kitty to a computer monitor?
 Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur.
 Happy kitty, sleepy…
 Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.
 Hey, look, it's Shamy.
 All righty. What's new?
 I got it. But what I was going for was, you know, how's your life?
 Okay, I'm just gonna walk away, 'cause I don't want to be here.
 So this is the plan? From now on, we're just gonna hide out in here to avoid the Shamy?
 Get one yourself.
 God, he's an ass when he drinks.
 I thought you were going to talk to Sheldon.
 Well, what'd he say?
 Kinda, sorta had to?
 Well, you defended me, right?
 What?
 No.
 No!
 Wow, that is better.
 Hey, Sheldon.
 I hear you broke up with Amy.
 Wow. That's like the worst country song ever. So, how are you doing?
 Amy.
 Well, breakups, or whatever the hell this is, can be tough.
 Okay. Good.
 What's up?
 Well, I'd ask you guys if you want dessert, but I know Sheldon doesn't eat dessert on Tuesdays. And even if Raj wanted something, he couldn't tell me. Howard won't order anything, but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words pie or cheesecake. And Leonard's lactose intolerant, so he can't eat anything here without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal.
 You want the fruit platter?
 Yeah.
 Oh, Howard, heads up. Your ex-girlfriend just came in for her shift.
 Ah, it's okay.
 Not since I found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it.
 Oh, absolutely.
 Yeah, sure. Just yesterday, she asked, why is Howard hiding under the table?
 Oh, no, not at first. Right after I pointed it out.
 Uh, not that I know of. Hey, while we're on the subject, why did you guys break up anyway?
 Howard, if you want my help, I've got to know what happened.
 Yeah, that's what I'm counting on. Spill.
 Um, the online game? Sure.
 Oh, God. I think I see where this is going.
 Oh, you're right. That is so embarrassing.
 Bernadette or the troll?
 Well, what was your side?
 Really? And that didn't make her feel better?
 Oh, gee, Howard, I really don't want to get in the middle of this.
 Okay, I will think about it.
 Yeah, I said I'd think about it.
 Okay, fine. Look, look, I'm calling her now! See?
 Hey, how are we doing over here? Can I get you something to drink?
 Are you gonna want to order food?
 Okay.
 That's what I told him when he asked me. I hope that's not out of line.
 Oh. I'm sorry.
 You know, you look thirsty. I brought you some iced tea.
 It's passion fruit, new on the menu.
 Oh, sorry. Yeah, you're right. Doy. So, Howard, trolls, yay or nay?
 Not where I can hear you guys.
 Yeah, that'll hold me for a while.
 Complimentary nachos! You enjoy. Never had sex? Wow.
 Hey, this is a little awkward, but my manager says I can't actually give nachos away. So, just take that when you're ready.
 Sheldon?
 What are you doing here?
 You know, they have a really nice bar over at the Olive Garden.
 Okay, Sheldon. What can I get you?
 Could you be a little more specific?
 I'm sorry, honey, I don't know millilitres.
 Would you say that's about 40 milliliters?
 Great. Now, where were we?
 A what?
 Here you go, one Rosewater Ricky.
 Oh, yeah, you know, every bartender makes it differently. Why don't you give it a try.
 All right. Sheldon, what's on your mind?
 Oh, right, that. Yes, Leonard told me. Sorry, honey.
 I drink.
 You know, sometimes stuff just happens, and there's nothing you can do about it. For example, Lisa Peterson hasn't talked to me since the 11th grade, because no matter how much you apologize, you can't go back and un-dry-hump someone's boyfriend.
 Exactly. Sometimes you can't win.
 Kirk cheated.
 Right there with you.
 What?
 What? Sheldon, you can't reprogram people.
 How long?
 Okay, help me out here. How does an archaeology professor get that good with a whip?
 And I can't believe you've never read Eat, Pray, Love.
 You know, I could totally rock a hat like that.
 Well, I'm watching it now. Why would I want to see it again on Friday?
 What, 21 seconds? That'll be like seeing a whole new movie!
 Yeah, I think I'll pass. But you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds.
 Mm, yeah, no, we wouldn't.
 Yeah?
 Oh. Um, it was, it was just going to be me and Bernadette. Besides, I thought you were going to the movies with Sheldon and the guys.
 Yeah, no, no, I-I-I got that.
 Uh, just wear something comfortable.
 You know Amy, when we say girl talk, it doesn't just have to be about our lady parts.
 Oh, thanks. I found this place in Alhambra. It's in a woman's basement. I think it's a front for human trafficking, but they do a really good job.
 So where should we go tonight? A bar? A club? A movie?
 All right, time to open Bachelor Number Two.
 That's okay. Y ou can just sleep here.
 Oh, gosh, Amy. I don't know if I would call this an actual slumber party.
 Not even when you were a kid?
 Okay. Well, I guess we're having a slumber party. Oh!
 Howard has a hairy chest?
 Okay, there you go, Sultry Sunrise Red. What do you think?
 And that, girls, is how you make a phony phone call.
 Okay, it's your game. You go first.
 Wait. No, Amy, you're supposed to ask her something personal or embarrassing.
 What the hell was that?
 Truth.
 Dare.
 Okay, look, just because we're not seeing each other anymore doesn't mean we can't be friends. I mean, Leonard's a great guy.
 I don't know. He got really serious, and I wasn't ready for it.
 You can only ask one question.
 You know what, I don't want to play anymore.
 Oh, hey, Amy. Look, I'm sorry I got so upset. I just,whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,whoa! What are you doing?
 Oh, hey, Leonard. I see you met my dad.
 Oh, gee, dad, Leonard can't stay. He just dropped by to say hello. Thanks for stopping by, sweetie. I'll see you later. Bye.
 Hey, can I talk to you out here for a sec?
 So you're probably wondering what that was all about.
 Yeah, okay. The thing is, I kind of told my father we got back together again.
 Well, you're the first guy he's ever really approved of, you know? You're a scientist who went to college and you don't have a neck tattoo or outstanding warrants or, or a baby.
 Just guys. Anyway, when I told him we split up, he was heartbroken, and he kept bugging me, how's Leonard? why can't you get back together with Leonard? I bet Leonard never tipped a cow over on himself. So to get him off my back, I told him we worked things out.
 What?
 Get over yourself. I whistled, you came running.
 Okay, why are you arguing about this?
 Oh, okay, whatever. Will you please just play along until my dad leaves?
 Come on, honey, not in front of my dad.
 Oh, dad, that's nice, but Leonard has to work. Right, Leonard?
 Oh.
 So not funny, dad.
 Oh, will you please let it go?
 Oh, see?
 Yeah, that's great. It's a funny story. Moving on.
 Curtis, and I'm pretty sure he was joking.
 Yeah, okay, I think this ends the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening.
 Oh, gee, dad, he'd love to, but Leonard has to work in the morning.
 No, no, no, you can't. Your career is far too important.
 Good night.
 Love you, too.
 Shut up. You know what I've been doing for the last hour?
 Listening to my father go on and on about what a great guy you are.
 Why are you making this so difficult?
 Leonard.
 No.
 I don't know.
 Maybe.
 Oh, my God. What personal habits?
 Okay, Sheldon, you don't have to do this because Leonard and I are not…
 No, you're right. No, there's, there's no plots, no trucks, no feet. So what other annoying habits shall we discuss?
 I'm sorry, daddy…
 Oh.
 You know, I'm sorry.
 You're right. Look, from now on, I will tell you the truth.
 Daddy, he had nothing to do…
 Okay.
 I love your little heart locket, Bernadette.
 Oh, so I spent seventh grade dotting my I's with little asses? Cool.
 Hey, Zack, what are you doing here?
 Yeah, I got it, I got it. Uh, Zack, these are my friends Bernadette and Amy.
 Yeah, you, too.
 Oh, we went out a couple of times.
 No, no. But in this case, yes.
 No, it was great. He just didn't really challenge me on an intellectual level.
 Wouldn't help. Zack can't even spell NPR.
 Oh, we know what's causing that, don't we?
 Hey. Isn't tomorrow your usual laundry night?
 That's thinking ahead.
 So how's Amy?
 Oh, no. Why?
 Just going to skip over that insult.
 Yeah. That's why I'm going to skip over it. Are you saying that Amy is, oh, what's the scientific word?
 Oh! Okay. Wow.
 Are you sure?
 I'm suggesting there might be something you could do about Amy's urges?
 Yeah. That's not what I had in mind.
 Exactly.
 Oh, Amy, you lucky girl.
 Hey, your copy of Science magazine was in my mailbox.
 Mm-hmm.
 Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again.
 Okay, we should, we should go.
 You know, for a group of guys who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied, you can be real jerks. Shame on all of you.
 You laughed.
 What?
 No.
 Wait, w-w-wait-wait-wait, you're ditching me to go look at comic books?
 I'm not happy.
 I'm still mad at you.
 What great news?
 Wait, why me? Wh-Why can't your girlfriend be Wonder Woman?
 Okay, what about your friend Amy?
 Okay, well, forget it. I'm not spending my New Year's Eve at a comic book store wearing a Wonder Woman costume.
 All right. Let's get this thing over with.
 No. I'm not wearing it. It looks stupid.
 Forget it. I'm not wearing the wig.
 Okay. You know what? I changed my mind. I'm not going.
 I'm not talking to you.
 What the hell is wrong with you?
 Okay. What do you want, Sheldon?
 Really?
 No. Wait, wait, does it?
 Good-bye, Sheldon.
 Go away, Sheldon.
 Oh. Go away, Leonard.
 It's open.
 I'm not going to that party, Leonard.
 It's not the wig.
 Okay, look. We're not really me and him.
 I don't know. I only started seeing Zack again so I wouldn't be alone on New Year's Eve. How pathetic is that?
 You make a cute Green Arrow.
 Like there's a difference.
 Whatever. Look, if Zack and I had just gone to a regular club or a party, it would have been fine, but this, with the costumes, and you.
 Nothing. Let's go to the party. How do I look?
 Ten, nine, eight…
 Seven, six…
 Five, four, three…
 Two, one! Happy New Year!
 Are you high?
 Who, me?
 What idea?
 Okay, stop, stop!
 Whatever your secret is, I'm sure it's boring, so I'm not interested.
 Bored.
 Hey, wait a minute.
 Hang on. Let's see where he's going.
 Oh, great. You know what? I've already mooched dinner off you guys. I don't need to listen to this.
 What you doing? Trying to contact your home planet?
 Oh.
 Something got you down, there, Sheldon?
 Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
 Is that so?
 Aw.
 Hey, you don't need Leonard and his app. You can make one with me.
 Seriously, I have a great idea for one.
 Okay, look, when you see someone wearing shoes you like, you just snap a picture of them, and the app goes on the Internet to find out where you can buy them.
 Well, you don't like it?
 Why not?
 And Leonard didn't want to work with you? Imagine that.
 Sheldon, I'm gonna make some cocoa. Do you want some?
 Milk.
 That's what it says on the packet.
 No, sorry.
 What does that mean?
 Hi. I'm sorry to bother you guys, but you've got to come take your Sheldon back.
 Well, he was moping down in the lobby, so I invited him over, and now I regret it.
 Look, can't you just let him play with you until bedtime?
 Okay. What if I got him to apologize and promise to behave?
 Okay. Wait right here.
 Oh, yes. He says they are lost without you.
 That's right.
 No, no, no. You know, they have suffered enough. Everybody's suffered enough. The thing is, you're going to have to offer him a face-saving way out of this.
 Say you're sorry.
 Okay. Um, how about this? You know how you're always trying to learn about sarcasm?
 No?
 Oh. Good for you. So all you have to do here is say you're sorry to Leonard, but say it sarcastically.
 Yeah. Yeah, that was my plan. All right. Come on. Let's go.
 Oh, you're welcome.
 Okay, these are Uggs. These are Crocs. These are knockoff Manolo Blahniks.
 Look, you said it yourself, we have to create a database before you can write an alga-thingy.
 Bored. Okay. These are Steve Maddens. These are Nine West. These are Target. Oh, but don't they look like Chanel? These are Michael Kors. These are Roxy. These are Sachel's. Oh, these are Betsy Johnson, they're so cute…
 Hey. So you guys ready to order?
 Okay. So, the usual, with extra spit on Sheldon's hamburger.
 Oh, gee, Amy, I'm sorry, I'm actually pretty busy this weekend.
 The what?
 Oh. Oh, okay, well, you know, like I said, I have plans, so.
 I'm your best friend?
 Oh, don't feel bad. I never read Leonard's, and I used to sleep with him.
 No, I really, I'm sorry, free what? Sorry, what, what?
 Wait, wait, just to be clear, when you guys say spa, does that mean the same thing as when regular people say it?
 You know, it is going to be difficult, but I'm going to cancel my plans so I can do this for my bestie.
 I, I wasn't going to.
 Boy, this is great. I haven't had a vacation in ages.
 You know, for a smart guy, you really seem to have a hard time grasping the concept, don't piss off the people who handle the things you eat.
 Yay!
 Brawny?
 So, Amy, I've been wondering, are you and Sheldon going to be sharing a room?
 Hey.
 Oh. Thanks.
 Terrific. Are we there yet?
 Uh, I don't know. Are you food?
 Well, it's a table, right? I mean, why can't there be food on it?
 Who elected you Road Trip God?
 I don't understand why you people just let him bully you like this. Someone should stand up to him. What's he going to do?
 I can't believe you let him kick me out of the car.
 Should I ask?
 Red Leader, I'm really sorry.
 You know what? I missed you, too.
 Will do.
 Um, sure. What do you, what do you got in mind?
 Um, I never really thought about it. Why?
 Really?
 Again, I've never given it much thought.
 Oh, good. Hey.
 Yeah. Why, what happened?
 Oh, yeah, that. Come on in.
 We are?
 Oh, right, right, the blog.
 Hey, can I stay here tonight?
 Well, Howard's a complete and total ass, Bernadette's in my bed, and no matter how much you stroke Amy's hair, she bites.
 Never mind. Can I stay here or not?
 All right.
 Well, I'm not getting in bed with him.
 We're just gonna have to make the best of this.
 Sleep.
 The what?
 Oh, okay. Just like old times.
 Sweetie, let me put this in a way you'll understand. From the waist down, my shields are up.
 Go to sleep.
 We are not having coitus.
 Yes.
 Leonard, are you asleep?
 I really appreciate you letting me stay here tonight.
 I know it's kinda weird.
 True dat?
 Right. Still mad at me about that?
 Thank you.
 Good for you.
 Good night. You know, maybe it wouldn't be the worst idea in the world to violate the Neutral Zone for just one night. Oh!
 We weren't getting back together! It was a one-time thing!
 Oh, shut up, Sheldon!
 Yeah, hi.
 Yeah, I have a question. Is there anybody who can get me the hell out of here and back to Los Angeles tonight?
 Hey, Leonard, is your wi-fi down? I can't get on.
 Thanks. What are you guys doing?
 Oh. How'd he do?
 That bad, huh?
 Listening to Dr. Cooper has made me want to start cutting myself again
 Oh, please let me tell him.
 What?
 I'm not an actress. I'm an actress.
 You want an acting lesson?
 Okay, where is this coming from?
 Yeah, I saw those. They were funny. I printed a few out and put 'em on my fridge.
 Okay, just to be clear. You are asking me for help because I know something that the brilliant Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn't.
 I think it's the only way to look at it.
 Probably. I'm just enjoying the foreplay. Does this mean you are done mocking my acting career?
 Forget it.
 Saturday, nine a.m. Bring cash.
 What's wrong?
 You were acting?
 Well, good for you. Come on in.
 Well, I thought we'd start with some basic movement exercises. You know, get our bodies warmed up a little.
 So I just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space. You know, just do whatever feels natural. Sheldon?
 Come on, you got to work with me. We need to get connected with our bodies.
 All right, let's just say we've warmed up.
 Okay. One of the things that might help you in connecting with your students is being a little more spontaneous. So why don't we try some improvisation?
 This is all about listening and responding.
 I'm going to create a character and a situation, and you just jump in when you feel it.
 All right.
 Okay, it's not a movie. It's improv. So no one calls action.
 Okay. Uh, no, the shipment has not arrived, and I really need those shoes. They are my biggest seller. Yes, ladies sizes six through ten. Thank you. Oh, sorry, I have to go, I have a customer. Bye-bye. Hi. Can I help you?
 Yogurt?
 Um, okay, sure. Luckily, we sell both shoes and yogurt here.
 Yes. Look up at the sign, and remember, improv is always about saying yes.
 What?
 Okay, you know what? Let's just try a different improv. Uh, oh, this time we will be two winos living under a freeway overpass.
 You bet. I had dreams, you know. I was gonna be famous. Show everybody back home I could be someone. Now look at me. Want some?
 So, did you get a chance to go over the scene I gave you?
 Okay, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is an American classic.
 Fine. What would you rather do as a scene study?
 And you think it's better than Tennessee Williams?
 Where No Sheldon Has Gone Before.
 KMN.
 Okay, that's fine, but let's try and get you out of your comfort zone.
 Okay, the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little, so I'm thinking you'll play the role of your mother, and I will bring life to Mr. Spock.
 It's only logical.
 All right.
 Okay, okay. We get it. You set the scene.
 Now just read your mother's line.
 Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo. Spock to Enterprise. Transport successful.
 Greetings, Mary Cooper. I am Spock.
 Just keep going!
 We have been monitoring your son Sheldon from the 23rd Century, and we have determined that he is now ready to join us. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy.
 Okay, okay, let's try that last line again, and this time, maybe try choking up a little.
 Well, you're losing your son.
 All right, come on, just try it my way. Pretend you're sad to see him go. I'm gonna lead you in. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy. That's your cue.
 All right, come on, come on. Put some real emotion into it. Blah-blah, blah, blah, vast and troubled galaxy. Go.
 That's good. That's good. That's good.
 Okay, I guess we're improvising now.
 Mrs. Cooper, hey, it's Penny. Yeah, I think I broke your son. Hey, hold on. Talk to your mother.
 There you go.
 Yeah, just tuck that part in your pants;  you'll be fine.
 Oh, Howard, I can't believe Bernadette let you go to a fancy party wearing a dickey.
 Sheldon, it's Saturday night, you'll be doing laundry.
 Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching.
 Leonard, are you okay?
 Okay, we can't keep explaining everything. Read that book we got you.
 You're really a broken toy, aren't you?
 What was all that about me trading sexual favours for material gain?
 He still won't shag the old lady, huh?
 Good morning, slut.
 Oh, please, I recognize the walk of shame when I see it. All you're missing is a little smeared mascara and a purse with panties wadded up in it.
 Oh, yeah.
 I believe that's what your roommate did to her.
 Again, read the book we gave you.
 Hey!
 Who can't go out with Leonard?
 Oh, yeah, you, too.
 Sheldon!
 Okay. Why?
 Amy, I'm fine.
 What?
 Really, I am not upset about Leonard and Priya.
 Oh. Well, good for him. Hey, what do you mean, more suitable?
 Yeah. Okay, I got it. I got it. So, what is all that stuff?
 Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza.
 Oh, yes. Hi, hi. I'm sorry. I didn't know you had company. I don't want to impose.
 If I had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator, I wouldn't have to take that.
 Hi. So, um, Priya, you're a lawyer, right?
 I'm fine.
 Oh, yeah, yeah. It's real great. Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial. Turned out to be porn.
 I didn't do the audition.
 Oh, hey. What's up?
 Why?
 I already told you, I'm okay with it. I mean, if anything, I'm quite pleased that Leonard has found someone that makes him so happy.
 Thank you.
 Okay.
 I smell Chinese food.
 Are Leonard and Priya here?
 Oh. Where's Raj?
 How about Howard?
 Oh, okay. Well, I guess it's just the two of us, huh?
 Great.
 Not really.
 Oh, sweetie, it's okay. I don't want tea.
 Oh. Hey, Sheldon. What can I get ya?
 Where are all your friends?
 Okay.
 Well, I was getting your stupid umbrella, but all right. What's troubling you, buddy?
 Oh, the horror.
 Ugh!
 There you go. Just like recovering alcoholics drink in the Caribbean.
 Oh. Hi, Amy. How you been?
 Yeah, it's a great time to be alive, isn't it?
 Look, Sheldon, Leonard is dating Priya. She is staying with Raj. That means you're all probably gonna be hanging out there more.
 Okay, I'm not upset about Leonard and Priya.
 A lot of people think I'm fun to be around.
 Ooh, I got one. If you guys were a band, you'd be called Leonard and the Leonards.
 Oh, hey.
 What's up?
 I kind of figured that.
 No.
 Oh. Gee, thanks, but I'm not really in the mood.
 Okay, look, if I agree to go out with you guys, will you promise to stop pestering me about Leonard and Priya?
 All right. I'll go change. Come on in.
 So, where do you guys want to go dancing?
 Oh, yeah, I know that place. What do you think?
 Okay, let's go through this one more time. Just because Leonard has a new girlfriend does not mean I need to go out and hook up with some guy.
 Well, yeah, I guess.
 More or less.
 I don't know. It's fun while you're doing it. And then after, it's mostly embarrassment, self-loathing and regret.
 Yeah, well, it's not gonna happen tonight. You know, for the first time in my life, I am not in a relationship, and I'm totally okay with it.
 Um, no.
 Oh, it's a snowflake from the North Pole. Leonard gave it to me last year.
 Yeah, it was.
 Let me see that. Oh, screw it. I can deal with a little self-loathing. Let's go find me a heinie to bite.
 One, two, three, four, five. No way.
 Seven of clubs! That is amazing!
 Oh, big deal. Not knowing is part of the fun.
 Hey, you look great. Good for you, Priya. I could never get that stupid hoodie off him when we were… well, you look great.
 I'm not going out with him. He can sleep with whoever he wants.
 Oopsy.
 You know, well, I'm happy Leonard's found someone. Not that anybody asked.
 Oh, unbelievable! Know how he did it yet?
 Aw, he has the same look my little nephew gets when he can't figure out how I got his nose.
 Hey, I think I know how you did the card trick.
 Come here.
 Not too bad for someone who doesn't know what axiomatic means.
 Hey, you. What happened with the contacts?
 Hey, is that one of the new shirts Priya got you?
 You don't wanna wash that.
 No, that's silk. Seriously, what would you do without me?
 You know, I gotta tell you, I think you got a real winner with Priya.
 She seems really sweet. Believe me, you do not want to take that for granted. There are a lot of bitches out there.
 All right, well I'll see you later.
 What?
 Did they make a movie about it?
 Then no.
 Okay.
 Uh, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?
 It's fun talking to you, Leonard, I always learn stuff.
 Hi! Hi! Just hang on.
 Hey! Look at Leonard in his fancy-ass grownup clothes. Way to go, Priya. For once, he doesn't look like a mannequin in the boys' department. Hey, did he tell you I saved the silk shirt?
 He was gonna throw it in the washing machine with his Spiderman underwear. That's our Lenny, huh?
 So, how's the food here? Oh, wow, that is really, really good. Oh, I'm sorry. You guys are on a date. We can hang out anytime. Have fun.
 Oh, that's, hot, hot, hot, hot! Whoo! It really sneaks up on ya, huh? All right, I gotta go.
 Oh, hey, I was just on my way to work.
 No, it's all right. Walk me down. So, what's up?
 Sure, anything.
 What?
 Okay, I'm not moving anywhere. What the hell is this all about?
 Oh, for god's sake, Leonard, this is about Priya, isn't it? She doesn't want me hanging out with you.
 Okay, look, I happen to like your girlfriend.
 No, she doesn't.
 It doesn't matter. Look, I promise from now on I will keep my distance from you.
 You can hear my toilet flush?
 Leonard, I get it. You're in a new relationship now. And I'm happy for you. So why don't we just shake hands and part friends?
 Are you really that kind of guy?
 Good-bye, Leonard.
 Hey.
 Oh, I know. Bernadette told me. Sorry, Sheldon. I know that game meant a lot to you.
 Okay, well, anyways, I brought you a day-old cheesecake to cheer you up!
 Just say thank you.
 All right. See you later.
 Oh, hi! I was just dropping off a cheesecake to Sheldon. He was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap that's useful in a make-believe place.
 Yeah, well, sadly, I do.
 Did you know last weekend Priya took Leonard rollerblading at the beach? Can you believe that?
 I am the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach in the first place. And he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste, I had to carry him to the water.
 So what's the thanks I get for turning Leonard into quality boyfriend material? I have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend.
 Want some coffee liqueur on your ice cream?
 You guys should've seen Leonard when I first met him. There was no eye contact. He was either looking up at the ceiling, or down at his shoes.
 You know, for the first couple of months, whenever I would take off my bra, he would giggle and say, oh boy, my breast friends.
 No, don't do that. No reason to be mean to her.
 No, but I can name all the Kardashians.
 Okay, be nice.
 Hi. We're just heading out for a drink.
 Don't listen to her, she's had a lot of ice cream. Do you want to join us?
 No problem. So, Leonard, I think it's interesting you didn't call your girlfriend to come get you.
 So you lied to her. Also interesting.
 Well, doesn't matter if she gets it, as long as she's pretty.
 So did you at least get Sheldon's fake stuff back?
 How come?
 All right. Hang on.
 I'm gonna show you how we finish a quest in Nebraska. Oh. Beyonce. This ain't no Beyonce.
 Give my friend his stuff back.
 Well, then, good news. Today's the day a girl's finally going to touch you in your little special place. Now give him his stuff back.
 Oh, hi.
 Going to see Leonard?
 Fine. You?
 Alright, well great seeing you.
 Amy's right. I do want to fling my poop at her.
 Hey! How's it going?
 ‘Course I heard about it. How did you hear about it?
 Oh, damn it. I told Amy that in the strictest confidence. Boy, some people are such blabbermouths. Well, whatever, I'm sure Bernadette can do better.
 You are kidding. Raj likes Bernadette?
 Okay, give. How do you know? Did he tell you?
 Well, then who?
 Priya told you. What a little gossip. You know, not an attractive quality in a woman, Leonard. Not judging, just my opinion.
 You don't have to worry. Unlike Amy and Priya, I know how to keep a secret.
 In confidence!
 Oh, hey, Amy. What's up?
 Hey, 16 wants to order appetizers.
 What the hell are you doing? Howard is your best friend, and that is his girlfriend. You should be ashamed of yourself.
 Well, I know that. How do you know that?
 Oh, that gossipy bitch! No offense.
 Okay, listen, just because Howard and Bernadette are having problems, does not mean you should be here sniffing around.
 All right, try thinking about this. Sheldon and Amy had sex.
 Yeah, it's true. Amy told me.
 I-I guess they just figured it out at some point.
 Oh, hey, Amy. Bernadette just texted me. Howard proposed?
 What?
 Hey. What's up?
 Oh, I'm sorry, honey, I'm meeting Amy and Bernadette for dinner. But you're welcome to tag along.
 Okay, suit yourself. We'll probably be trashing Priya a little.
 Okay, I'd like to propose a toast to a wonderful girls night out.
 I felt sorry for him. Priya's giving him a hard time.
 Pantsuits suck.
 That's too many S's for kissing.
 Sheldon, have you ever kissed a girl?
 Yeah, you're a scientist, where is the curiosity?
 Hey, I know, let's take Sheldon dancing.
 Did you take dance lessons?
 Oh, we are so taking you dancing.
 Take us to a place we can waltz.
 Shake it baby, shake it!
 Oh, what the hell. Ooh!
 Glad you're enjoying yourself.
 I'm fine.
 Yeah, I said I'm fine. Stop talking to me.
 Screw it. I'll go later.
 Oh, that's nice.
 Okay, Amy, you're being silly. I am not concerned about who hangs out with who. And I certainly don't have a problem with Leonard's new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. Ooh, these are cute. Of course if I buy them, I'll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.
 Wait. What are you talking about?
 Okay, I don't know you people. I'm just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my Texaco card.
 No. Once these puppies touch the ground they're mine, and I'll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in order to pay them off. Pretty, pretty, pretty.
 The what?
 Hey. Seriously? Didn't you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?
 None?
 Wh… What the hell did she say?
 That bitch!
 Um, okay. Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I'm on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.
 What? I don't know. It doesn't matter.
 All right, guys, you have to go back. I can't afford you. “No, don't send us away, we love you.” I love you, too, but you cost more than my rent. “But, Penny, you look so good in us.” Damn it, the shoes are right.
 What?
 What, are they getting engaged?
 All right, look, just forget about the astronaut.
 Look, just find out what's up with this trip to India.
 Don't you quit on us!
 Hey, do me a favour and take table seven.
 Nah, I prefer to look at it as the one with my ex-boyfriend and his gorgeous, successful and sophisticated girlfriend, who makes me feel like a toothless Okie.
 Oh, please, you're not that kind of person.
 Hey.
 Haven't seen you in a while. How's it going?
 I don't know, maybe, I have no idea what you said.
 My mirth. Classic.
 It's not a big deal, Sheldon. It's just, ever since Leonard's been dating Raj's sister, I've had to keep my distance. I don't get to hear all your jibber-jabber.
 What are you doing at work these days?
 Alright, come on, even you have to admit that's jibber-jabber.
 Oh, my God, you're about to jibber-jabber about jibber-jabber.
 Oh, my God! What happened?
 Okay.
 Okay, well, your friend and his mother are there, we're going.
 Oh, don't tell me you're afraid of germs.
 Okay, you know what? You are unbelievable. You buy all these superhero T-shirts, but when it's time for you to step up and do the right thing, you just hide in the laundry room.
 Hang on a second, you picked up your mother? Her own legs are barely able to do that.
 Yeah, I'm saying, it'd be easier to lift a car.
 What's the difference?
 Thanks for clearing that up.
 Okay, you're not helping.
 How else is she supposed to take it?
 Well, he's my friend. It's what you do.
 It's just so weird. Howard Wolowitz is my friend. You know, once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat and I broke his nose.
 Yeah, tell me about it.
 You mean when he was little.
 You know, this stuff is horrible. You want to see if we can find the cafeteria and get real coffee?
 You want to talk about crazy mothers, Leonard's mom wouldn't give him any sort of approval growing up.
 It makes him desperate to please women. That's why the foreplay goes on and on.
 It's like he's trying to win a prize. A word of advice, don't doze off. You will never hear the end of it.
 Yeah, I know, right?
 We were just comparing notes about how you are in the sack.
 Yeah.
 Hey, you guys ready to order?
 Okay, Priya?
 Yeah, a little tip
 Oh!
 Wow, so that means you're a doctor, you're a doctor, you're a doctor, you're a doctor, and Howard, you know a lot of doctors.
 Yeah, just a heads-up on the car window deal. It helps, but everything is not peachy.
 Hey, Sheldon, did you change your Wi-Fi password again?
 Thanks. Wow! What's with the fancy spread?
 What do you mean, new roommate? What happened to Leonard?
 All right, let me try this again. Where's Leonard?
 Woah, Leonard and Priya are living together? That's big.
 Oh, no, no, no. I've had way too much already.
 Hit me.
 Monkeys.
 When a suitcase just won't do.
 Okay, explain something to me. You watch Leonard put up with that guy for years and years. What has to break inside your brain for you to think, Oh, Krishna, I've got to get me some of that?
 What? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah. Leonard's a noisy little dude in the sack.
 Really? Even during allergy season, when he has to alternate between kissing and breathing?
 Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Can I tell you a secret?
 I screwed up. Leonard's a great guy. Never should have broken up with him.
 Oh, you poor baby.
 Nothing, nothing. You know, if we weren't friends, and you hadn't brought up that creepy pornography story, I'd be on you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy.
 I listen. I have no idea what it means, but I listen. To friendship.
 Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh. Okay, look. This never happened. Do you understand me? Really? Still can't talk to me?
 Damn.
 Oh. It's, it's not what it looks like.
