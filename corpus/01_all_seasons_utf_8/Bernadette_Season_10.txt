 Because you were driving like a lunatic.
 It didn't help that you couldn't walk a straight line when the cop pulled you over.
 Yeah, if you want to go off the grid, you have to move out of your mother's house.
 Howard, please just call the man, see what he wants.
 Okay, I think we're ready.
 We're here today to celebrate love.
 Not just Leonard and Penny's love, but the love we have for them, as well as each other.
 Love is patient, but it's not gonna put up with all the side chatter, so let's knock it off.
 Howard.
 Anybody have anything snarky to say about that? Didn't think so.
 Thank you. All right, let's continue.
 Okay. I now pronounce you husband and wife. And weird other husband who came with the apartment.
 I'm worried about Howard. Ever since that guy from the Air Force showed up, he's been a nervous wreck.
 He won't take any pills that aren't chewable and shaped like a Flintstone.
 I don't believe this.
 This guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant.
 No one at the office did. Did you tell anyone?
 I bet it was Barbara Chen in retrovirus. She might have heard me throwing up one morning. Every since she got the hearing aid, she thinks she's so great.
 ‘Cause I'm up for a major immunotherapy study, and if they find out I'm pregnant they might give it to someone else.
 I know they would, they did it to Barbara Chen last year when I told everyone she was pregnant.
 I had a plan. I kept leaving Dove Bar wrappers around to explain any weight gain.
 From all the Dove Bars I ate. I'm pregnant. Try to keep up. I'm sorry, I have to go find out if my boss knows.
 Thanks. You guys are the best.
 I forgot my coat.
 Hey. What brings you by?
 Oh. How was it?
 Fell asleep?
 I'm furious.
 No. I confronted Barbara Chen, but she claimed she didn't know what I was talking about.
 It had to be Barbara. I've been trying to figure out a way to get back at her. Do you think using her work computer to Google how to be a prostitute is over the line?
 What kind of revenge is that? This woman screwed with my job. She's got to pay.
 Why did you do that?
 Get out.
 Oh, thanks. You know, I just wanted to get some work done without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes.
 Did you come here to bring me dinner or to gloat?
 I'm sorry. My boss wants to meet with me, and I'm stressing.
 Are you kidding? I've always been treated differently. Look at me. Listen to me. I mean, the first thought when you see me isn't that's a scientist, it's I wonder if her mommy knows where she is.
 I've worked so hard to get where I am, and I don't want to get sent back to square one because I'm pregnant.
 Thank you.
 Well, you brought me French fries. That's a start.
 Apple slices? What kind of lunatic goes to McDonald's and gets fruit?
 And a chocolate shake.
 Got a minute?
 I just wanted to apologize. I know what you did was an accident.
 For what it's worth, you're a great liar.
 Well, my boss said he hadn't decided yet, so I gently reminded him that he's an old rich white guy, and I'm a sweet little pregnant lady who's not afraid to crying front of a jury.
 Hey, I learned a long time ago, when you're four feet eleven and eye level with every guy's crotch, that's where you punch.
 Do you know what? It's just a research project. The most important job in the world is gonna be raising this child. It's all I need to give my life meaning.
 You believe me? Oh, good. 11 more chumps like you, I'll have the jury eating out of my hand.
 It's okay.
 You shouldn't have made the alarm code his birthday.
 Oh, I appreciate it, but you don't have to spend your day off with me.
 Not really.
 I get enough of that when I take Howard to my grandmother's for Christmas.
 Isn't it a little early for that?
 Oh, there's so much junk in there, it's embarrassing.
 I don't think you are.
 I don't even know where to begin.
 Oh, I was gonna start at the end. Thank God you're here.
 Sorry. I should probably keep this in case we have a girl.
 My dad built it for me.
 This was the husband and this was the wife. They'd go out on adventures together. Cruises, skiing, horseback riding. That was really me just duct taping them to our dog.
 They did, but the mommy and daddy didn't like them, so they shipped them off to an orphanage I made out of a shoebox.
 Not every girl dreams about being a mom. Sometimes you think you're never gonna have kids and one day you wake up and you're pregnant. And it doesn't matter that your career's going great right now and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere taped to a dog.
 Sorry I flipped out on you. I think it's just hormones.
 Does it really need one?
 Well, it doubled as my dad's office, and he was a cop, so I guess the theme was bloody homicide photos.
 Are you just gonna name all the colours?
 I don't care what colour the room is.
 Well, you're not, so just drop it. I'm clearly upset. Why aren't you following me?
 I don't know.
 Raj, why don't I care about anything?
 It's my baby. I, I should care about nurseries and colours, and I don't. What's wrong with me?
 I keep waiting to feel excited, but it's not happening. What if it never happens?
 Once, I was supposed to babysit my brothers. Our neighbour found them naked in the backyard eating crickets.
 What? Why? Who are you calling? You're gonna rat me out to Howard, aren't you? You're such a snitch, no wonder I don't like you.
 Something's wrong. I don't care about any of the baby stuff every other mom is so into. Honestly, I'm not even sure I like babies.
 But I thought I'd be more excited.
 Thank you. I feel better now.
 It would help if you stopped telling me I have a textbook cervix.
 Let me see the sonogram again. Oh, yeah, that's a good-looking baby for a little grey blob.
 What if it's a girl?
 Are we being silly not finding out the sex?
 Hmm. The doctor's gone for the day, so it doesn't matter.
 You looked in our folder?!
 God, Raj.
 We don't want you to know.
 This is ridiculous. The doctor knows what the baby is, the ultrasound tech knows, Raj knows, his Grey's Anatomy online fan group probably knows. Is it weird we don't?
 I was disappointed to see the man I was engaged to pulling rainbow scarves out of his fly.
 Everyone said I could do better.
 Good. Call him. Wait, I'm not sure I want to know.
 Well, now I don't know if I want to know!
 Yes.
 Wait.
 I changed my mind, hang up, hang up.
 The only thing I hate more than you right now is that book.
 Next vomit is gonna be in your lap.
 But it's our last chance to take a vacation that's just the two of us.
 Keeping secrets from our friends, it does sound kinda fun.
 You just heard me throwing up.
 You're so weird.
 That feels great.
 Can you please stop making money come out of me for two minutes? Was that the front door?
 Lock the door, lock the door.
 Uh, I left my phone downstairs.
 Wait, I have my iPad.
 That's not helpful.
 Let me know when you start, because that wasn't funny.
 Who would use our hot tub?
 Who is it?
 Should we say something to him?
 I meant like, what are you doing here?
 Is it me, or is there something fun about watching him just float there?
 Is someone else here?
 What?
 I told you raccoons don't say uh-oh.
 You said you got it back.
 Why wouldn't he tell us? Are we bad friends?
 Yeah, he deserves to be alone.
 What do you do in there?
 What are you doing?
 Oh, yeah, that's where I put it.
 Which MIT did you go to?
 Howie, we have time to do all that stuff.
 The next person kicking you will be me. Good night.
 I warned you, and I did it.
 Hey, where you been?
 You bought a crib without me?
 Sounds expensive.
 Fine.
 You bought a minivan?
 I don't want to drive that. It's such a mom car.
 They thought it at the ultrasound, why not at the car dealership?
 I'm probably thinking, where's my husband, and why isn't he helping me?
 It's weird that guy thought you were a couple.
 Oh, is it your back?
 Do we really have to sit for hours in the emergency room? They're just gonna give you ice and Advil like last time.
 Fine, we'll go to the E.R. Just stop selling me on the van.
 I was hoping it'd be quieter.
 Soon.
 Fine. I'll buy the stupid van.
 Actually, it's been ready for weeks.
 Well, they finished the work early, but she's been telling Sheldon they're behind schedule.
 Hey.
 One sec. Why did you tell Leonard I told you Penny was hiding his things?
 Amy, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said anything.
 Still, I can't believe you can turn ordinary skin cells into functioning brain cells.
 Look at that, put them in a tiny Flash T-shirt and it's you.
 I'm running out of ways to act excited.
 Great, the doctor said the baby's head is facing down now.
 Are you actually comparing my human baby to your brain in a bowl?
 You do realize my baby has functioning organs and can recognize voices.
 Mine has a fully developed immune system.
 Who is it?
 Where did you get that?
 Why would you buy it?
 Last question. What is wrong with you?
 Howie, it's in poor taste.
 Okay, call him and show him. I dare you.
 Fine, then do it.
 While you're bothering the world's most famous scientist, be sure to show him how funny he looks getting stuck under our dishwasher.
 I can't imagine you being violent.
 I thought it was brave. Does that count as liking it?
 I think he looks cute.
 Stuart, you didn't have to get us a baby gift.
 A foot massage?
 How come this one's on the back of an eviction notice?
 Stuart, we'd love to help you out, but this a bad time, we're about to have a baby.
 Thank you, but I'm not really sure.
 I guess you could stay for a few days and we'll see how it goes.
 Hmm. Actually I just did that this morning.
 I did that, too.
 Howard just did that.
 Stuart, you cooked?
 There's only three people in this house, and you'd still be my fifth guess.
 You have a Batsuit.
 Yeah, we've been meaning to do that.
 Thank you again for cooking. It's getting tough for me to be on my feet all day.
 Do something, Batman.
 Great, go with the giraffes.
 Yeah, you're probably right, go with the zebras.
 Hey, could you please go to the market for me?
 Howie, they've been doing everything for you.
 Please just go to the store.
 Take Raj. Stuart is supposed to paint my toenails.
 Howard!
 I think I'm in labour.
 I love you, too.
 Here comes another contraction.
 I'm sorry. It's our first time.
 Not that old school. He knows.
 We showed up too early. We'll keep you posted.
 Do you really need to record this?
 Raj.
 How could you?
 Raj.
 Here comes another one. Hey, Squinty, the gas pedal's on the right.
 I'm so thirsty. Give me more ice chips.
 We could name her after your mom.
 Did she have a middle name?
 Let's keep thinking.
 I know.
 She did always have candy in her pocket.
 I didn't know her five minutes and she asked, are you a Milky Way or a Snickers girl?
 I remember thinking this is stupid, and I was right.
 No. If one more person puts their fingers near my uterus, I'm gonna cross my legs and snap 'em off.
 Hi.
 Sorry we're late.
 Really? So you can control it?
 I couldn't explain it if I tried.
 It's like I was excited for a present and got socks.
 Sure.
 It's been wonderful, Sheldon, thanks for asking.
 Oh, please stop crying, I'm begging you. I don't know what else to do. My boobs are empty. Do you want lasagna? Shh, shh, shh, it's okay, it's okay. Shh. What have we done?
 It took me two hours to get her down.
 That was so fast.
 Yeah, he has a gift.
 Nothing, these are happy tears.
 No they're not, you bozo. How come Stuart can get her to stop crying, but I can't?
 Not funny.
 Everyone's a better mom than me.
 How can she hate me? I make her food in my chest. It's like hating a frozen yogurt machine.
 Now you hate me too.
 Thank you, Sheldon, I'm feeling better now.
 Yeah, eventually I figured out how to get the baby to sleep.
 Shh. She's asleep.
 Down here.
 I didn't know what else to do. It worked.
 Don't make me laugh.
 I think I live here now. It's fine.
 Yeah, go ahead.
 Don't make me cry, either.
 We love you, too.
 I could take a bath in the sink. I don't, but I can.
 Yeah, thanks.
 Things going well with you and Sheldon living together?
 I've been seeing him for years, I'm still not convinced he's real.
 Uh oh, what's going on?
 It's okay, Howie never has on pants. The Domino's guy brings the pizza like this now.
 Okay. Thanks, daddy. He said the only way to really fix an old floor like that is to tear it up and replace the whole thing.
 I have one. What if you got a giant slingshot and flung yourself into the wall?
 You actually expect me to do this while holding a baby in the dark.
 So, normal.
 You know, I just read that a team at MIT. developed a device that helps people read human emotions.
 It's supposed to be accurate, like, 85% of the time.
 Wouldn't that be nice.
 I like the first one.
 Is that Emily your ex-girlfriend?
 Why would you do that, Raj?
 You're not gonna get information, you're just gonna get criticism that hurts your feelings.
 I finally got Halley to sleep.
 Let's see. You're better than us, a little bit sorry for us, but mostly glad you don't have to be us.
 For Howie's occupation, should I include that he was an astronaut?
 Well, I didn't. I also skipped a birthing class to see Zootopia so back off.
 Sorry. Howie's back at work and there's just so much going on.
 Sure. Open up a college fund, shop for life insurance, and in the laundry room, there's a mountain of dirty laundry. Wash it or burn in, your choice. Ugh, be right back.
 Oh, thank you.
 That sounds really nice.
 We will. Got my dancing shoes, got my breast pump. Let's party.
 Call if there's any problems.
 Call me. Don't call Howard.
 Not yet, but we're gonna apply to a bunch of others just to keep our options open.
 Oh, it's Raj. Everything okay?
 Raj, what's going on?
 I'm sure it's fine, but if you're worried, there's extra milk in the freezer.
 Stuart, don't you drink my milk.
 Hello?
 You guys got this? Do you need me to come home?
 Yeah. I may have just left my infant daughter with Patrick and SpongeBob.
 Yeah, we're all dressed up. Why go home?
 What's going on with you?
 I'm not sad. I just wanted to get drunk and not wear sweatpants.
 You're upset I had a baby?
 You think that stuff is fun? Being a parent is terrifying. I'm constantly worried, I'm always tired, and in a few minutes I'm gonna milk myself in a bookstore parking lot.
 You may not have a house yet, but your apartment's great.
 And Leonard loves you so much, he married you twice.
 Careful. The sound of crying can make me lactate.
 And there they go.
 Oh, it's okay. It's good to get out of the house.
 That's so sweet of you.
 Oh, I'm sure that's not true.
 Yeah, maybe your dad's right.
 Is it really that high?
 Oh, my God, you really are spoiled.
 When you moved here, you didn't have a lot of money. How'd you get by?
 I'm sorry, Raj. We really just don't have the space.
 What if you stop helping?
 That's a great idea.
 Okay.
 Making lasagna.
 You want something stupid, or you did something stupid?
 Oh, dear God, you're cheating on me with Raj.
 What is it?
 It's so hard to say no to you.
 So I'll say maybe.
 You said tickets don't go on sale till Friday, right?
 You said you were gonna do all this stuff for me, right?
 See where I'm going with this?
 If you don't know how to make lasagna, Google does.
 Howie, can you get that?
 Busy like I'll be with the baby if you go to San Diego?
 No.
 I really should wear a bell around my neck so you guys can hear me coming.
 Thank you.
 There she goes.
 I appreciate it.
 He's such a sweetie.
 If he could find a girl with a job, all his problems would be over.
 Kinda.
 Howie?
 It's back pay for all the babysitting and taking care of Halley you've done.
 And you live here for free.
 Keep it. Consider it a gift.
 What's the difference?
 You just don't want to go alone with Sheldon.
 What's so funny?
 Don't post that, be supportive.
 We're smart. I'm sure we can think of something.
 Oh, we're smarter than that.
 Where would he stay? We already have Stuart.
 That sounds awful.
 Not for you, box of towels.
 It's fine. It's just Raj. You can hit him with the bat, but it's fine.
 Don't do that. We'll make up the couch for you and figure out something in the morning.
 You know she's at my parents' house, right?
 Just not in our bedroom, you dumbass.
 Good. Nobody needs a mooch living in their house forever.
 Well, if your idea of fun is riding in a minivan to Target for diapers, things are about to get nuts.
 Well, are you worried he's like another man in her life?
 Well, have you talked to them about it?
 Look, Raj just gets along with women.
 Jennifer still trying to sleep her way to the top?
 Yeah, I wish I had that with Howard.
 Let's see, the magic store, the Doctor Who convention, the National Belt Buckle Collector's meet and greet.
 You're entitled to feel how you feel. If you don't like it, you should just talk to her.
 Oh, then maybe you shouldn't talk to her.
 Hey.
 No problem.
 Okay.
 Already cleared the browser history.
 Trying to catch up on office e-mails before I go back.
 Yeah, I mean, I'll miss Halley, but it'll be nice to get out of the house, be intellectually stimulated. Go out to lunch instead of, you know, be lunch.
 Yeah, I mean, with you and my parents, she's gonna be fine.
 And that day care is great.
 Plus, I, I think I'm setting a good example for Halley, to show her that women can be mothers and still have satisfying careers. Sure, she won't know where I went or if I'm ever coming back. That'll just make the ten minutes between when I get home and her bedtime even more special.
 It's okay, I'm just being emotional about this. Can you not tell Howard?
 Don't you think it'd be healthier if you had your own apartment, grown man?
 Stuart, you didn't have to make dinner.
 Meatloaf.
 Stuart made it.
 Sounds great.
 Hmm, guess it should be me.
 Of course, why?
 No, I'm fine.
 Fine.
 Love you, too.
 Okay, you won. Can I finish what I'm doing?
 Something on your mind?
 Nope, all good.
 No, what is wrong with you?
 Howard, I'm sorry if I'm being weird, but it has nothing to do with you.
 No. I didn't want to tell you, but I'm having a really tough time about going back to work.
 It was?
 I just don't know what the right thing to do is. If I go back to work, I'm abandoning Halley. If I don't go, I'm giving up everything I worked for. It's like there's no right choice.
 I guess.
 I'm not crazy about you calling our baby dumb.
 I don't like when you imitate me.
 I'm on the day care's website.
 What if she likes the people who work there more than us?
 When I go back to work, we're gonna leave her with these people. We don't know anything about them.
 Well, sloth babies cling to their mothers' bodies for almost a year. I'm going back to work after only four months, so I've learned I hate myself, I hate sloths, and I hate you for bringing me here.
 It's not just the sloth. Polar bears nurse their cubs for almost eight months. The orangutan mother builds her baby a new home every night. And what do I do? I choose my career over my child.
 Yeah, eventually. She's still not happy about taking a bottle, though.
 No, I'll be fine.
 It would be nice to raise Halley to be a little more independent than you were.
 Well, guess I'm ready to go.
 You have everything she needs for day care?
 Okay. Okay, sweetie, Mommy's gonna go to work now, so you have fun today.
 Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
 She's not gonna see us all day, and she doesn't even care.
 How's she doing?
 I see a wall, floor, some Asian baby, there she is.
 Thank you. Okay, I'm gonna try and get some work done.
 Love you, too. Bye.
 You realize they called when you took her.
 See? This is the right thing for her. Let's all just go to work.
 Let me just say good-bye. Halley. Look at Mommy. Over here, honey. Say good-bye to Mommy. Look at me. Look at your mother. All right, we can go.
 Yeah, they say the yeast in beer helps with milk production.
 Ruin it for me and I'll break this glass over your head.
 Yeah, breastfeeding burns, like, 5,000 calories a day. Do not touch that phone.
 So you wanted to learn something physical and you came to Howard Wolowitz?
 Yes, I'm juggling my love for you and my embarrassment of you right now.
 Is it I'm going to die alone?
 Really? I have no trouble believing that at all.
 We're talking about the same Leonard, right?
 I would never let Howard work with an ex.
 I wouldn't trust her. He's thin and sexy like a Jewish greyhound.
 And I'd like to think Howie wouldn't take a job I was uncomfortable with.
 Terrified.
 Hey, I didn't know you were home. Where you been?
 Seriously, where were you?
 Why?
 Oh. What'd she say?
 First of all, that's not what she sounds like, she's from South Carolina.
 Okay, it's not like I wanted to be a ventriloquist. I was in beauty pageants and I needed a talent besides spreading rumours that the other contestants were pregnant.
 No. And the little lady has a name.
 Tammy Jo St. Cloud.
 Sorry, you're not a dork. You're a clown. Tammy Jo, don't say that, you'll make him feel bad. Look at him, what reason he got to feel good?
 Don't listen to her, she's been in a box for, like, 25 years. Yeah, back when his haircut was fashionable.
 Oh, big daddy, I don't think so. You marry Miss Bernie, you marry me. We all family now.
 Don't be that way. If you don't mind a few splinters, we can have us a ménage à trois. Ooh.
 Yeah, you guys did this all on your own.
 So what happens next?
 So you're gonna be roommates with Bert?
 Hey, that's amazing.
 You're kidding. Why would they do that?
 You doing okay?
 Want me to put on some Neil Diamond? That always makes you feel better.
 You might be forgetting another accomplishment of the past year.
 Really? That's the importance you put on us having a baby?
 Really? He doesn't put raisins or banana slices or anything in it?
 You're still gonna go, right?
 Well, distance might be nice. The last time a big project ended for Howie, he wouldn't stop following me around. He even went with me to get a mammogram.
 No, he wanted to get one with me, like some kind of weird couple's massage.
 You're excited about this opportunity, right?
 You have to go.
 I'm telling you, if you don't go you'll end up regretting it.
 Oh, great.
 Oh.
 It's too late for me. Save yourself.
 Come here, let's talk.
 Just listen. I don't know if you realize this, but whenever you're between projects, you tend to get a little insecure.
 A little clingy.
 Oh, oh, oh, okay, stop. Stop. I love when you're affectionate, but this is not coming from a good place.
 I signed us up for ballroom dance class.
 I made us have a baby.
 Bring it in.
 That's nothing, Howie said she touched his hand.
 No.
 Should we call Amy?
 I guess we could wait till we have more information about this girl.
 Ugh. How can you think that? Why would you even put those words together?
 Nowitzki. I googled her, she's pretty cute.
 Which he only did once.
 We didn't want you to worry.
 Yeah, but you're gonna be back in three months.
 That's ridiculous. As far as we know, all that happened is two scientists had lunch.
 Yeah, there's a million reasons a woman would shoot Raj down.
 Fine, hundreds.
Hi.
 Can I just squeeze in here?
 I threw my body at them, what else did you want me to do?
 To do what? Shake a can of nickels at them?
 Excuse me.
