 Oh, that's very interesting.
 Yeah, but it doesn't really answer my question.
 Do you want some.
 Right.
 Got it.
 What are you doing?
 I didn't feel a draft.
 Oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow things down a little.
 No, I know, I… I know what you meant, it's just… it's only our first date.
 Or we could just wing it.
 Goodnight Leonardrd.
 Hi.
 Thanks.
 Sheldon, may I ask you a question?
 Alright, I heard yes, so… okay, here's my question, has Leonardrd ever dated, you know, a regular girl.
 No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn't a braniac?
 How is that not a braniac?
 So, do you think that if Leonardrd and I keep dating he'll eventually get bored with me.
 On what?
 No.
 No.
 Okay, okay, you know, I get it, Leonardrd has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college.
 Well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didn't want him to think I was some stupid loser.
 You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates.
 Right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot tell Leonardrd any of this.
 Yeah.
 What?
 Okay, look, if Leonardrd finds out that I lied, I will absolutely die of embarrassment.
 Oh Sheldon, please, look, I'm asking you as a friend.
 Well, yeah.
 Hi guys.
 Oh, um, you know, I think I have the dinner shift on Friday.
 You know, I'm not sure, the manager hasn't posted the schedule yet, how about I let you know.
 Also today we have a fresh caught Alaska salmon, and that's served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice. Our soup of the day…
 Sheldon, I'm working.
 Oh, look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?
 Look, just forget I told you about me not graduating from community college. Okay?
 Okay, look, you promised me you would keep my secret so you're just going to have to figure out a way to do it.
 Hi.
 What are you talking about.
 He told you?
 Pasadena city college?
 Wow, I get it, because Dr Leonardrd Hofstadter can't date a girl without a fancy college degree.
 Right, but I have to have some sort of degree to date you?
 So, it's fine with you if I'm not smart.
 Hi guys. Looks like you've been to the Renaissance fair. I'm hoping.
 Okay, fine, whatever, um, you guys, this is my friend Eric.
 Yeah, yeah, it's good to see you too. We should really go.
 Bye guys.
 Sheldon? What are you doing?
 Yeah, but why are you doing it on the stairs?
 Oh. Oh, well, good for him. Yeah but, why are you sitting here, why don't you just go to a movie or something?
 Yeah, why not?
 Well then don't order popcorn.
 Well why don't you go to a coffee shop.
 They have other things.
 I don't know, you know, cookies, pastries…
 Yeah, sure.
 Well, they have a lot in common. I mean they're both scientists.
 Okay, well I have a date too, so see ya.
 No, it wasn't my cat, it was an experiment designed by this guy named Schrodinger.
 No, he was some kind of scientist, let me start again. Oh, hey Leonardrd.
 Leslie.
 Okay, well, goodnight. 
 Okay, goodnight.
 Had a great time, ciao.
 Hey, Sheldon.
 Third floor tonight. Mixing it up?  Oh. You know, I still don't understand why you just don't go to dinner or something.
 Goodnight Sheldon.
 Excuse me?
 Okay, where is this coming from?
 Your arch enemy?
 Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.
 Sheldon, come back, you're losing me.
 Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
 I know. I heard.
 Oh, gee, well, thankyou for that. But, um, I think for now Leonardrd and I are just going to stay friends.
 Sheldon, you are a smart guy, you must know…
 Are you going to let me talk?
 You must know that if Leonardrd and Leslie want to be together, nothing you can do is going to stop it.
 Okay, let me put it this way, if you're really Leonardrd's friend you will support him no matter who he wants to be with.
 Because love trumps hate.
 Okay. Goodnight Sheldon.
 Yes, I can't get my stupid door open.
 Yeah!
 Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit.
 I can't get the damned key out.
 Thankyou, Sheldon.
 Why? I'll tell you why. Because today I had an audition, it took me two hours to get there, I waited an hour for my turn, and before I could even start they told me I looked too Midwest for the part. Too Midwest? What the hell does that even mean?
 I know what it means, Sheldon! God, you know, I have been in L.A. for almost two years now, and I haven't got a single acting job, I have accomplished nothing, haven't gotten a raise at work, haven't even had sex in six months, and just now when I was walking up those stairs a fly flew in my mouth and I ate it.
 Oh, sonofabitch!
 I did, and he said he'll get here when he gets here.
 No! I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything and my breath smells like fly. 
 No Sheldon, I'd rather sit on this freezing cold floor sobbing like a three year-old.
 For God's sake!
 Sheldor?
 What are you doing?
 Oh.
 What's AFK?
 OIC.
 Oh, I see?
 Oh, I don't know. Can I see them in another colour?
 Leonardrd, guess what, I'm a level three warrior.
 Yeah yeah yeah, shhh!
 Uh-huh, yeah, do I stay in the jungle or go towards the beach?
 Okay. Wait, wait, where are you going?
 Oh my God, a treasure chest, I'm rich!
 Hi!
 Yeah, okay. Listen, I need to talk to Sheldon.
 Okay, look, I bought the game, and I've been exploring the Island of Tordage but I can't figure out how to get past the guard captain.
 No, no, I've a bronze dagger.
 Alright, alright, how do I get the sword?
 Is that the place on the hill with the weird priests in front of it?
 Thank you, I really appreciate this.
 Don't patronise me, just get the sword.
 Right, gimme, gimme, gimme, I want to kill the guard captain. 
 Sheldon. Shel-don.
 No danger, look, it's just me, Penny, look, I got to level 25 and reached Purple Lotus Swamp, right?
 Yeah. Leonardrd gave me an emergency key.
 Okay, well can we go talk in the living room?
 Why not?
 Well, wear different pyjamas.
 Okay, just tell me, is it too soon to join a quest to the Black Castle?
 Yeah, yeah, by some guys in Budapest, I'm just not sure it's the right move for my character.
 Really? Boy, you'd think you could trust a horde of Hungarian barbarians.
 Okay, well you were great, thanks. Oh, hey Leonardrd, listen, don't got in Sheldon's room, he's not wearing bottoms.
 No, Fritz, I need you on my flank. No, I don't know German. Flankenzie, flankenzie!
 Busy.
 I don't work on Mondays.
 Uh, Queen Penelope AFK. What?
 Yeah, get to the point, I'm about to level up here.
 Yeah, jabber jabber jabber, okay boys, Queen Penelope's back online.
 Oh, thanks. 
 Leonardrd, I said not now.
 I said not now. 
 Okay, I'm at the gate to the Treasury of the Ancients, I'm going in.
 Got it.
 22.
 Oh, here come the mummies, which spell do I use? The hateful strike, or the frenzy stance?
 I dumped them, they're a bunch of wussies.
 Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy!
 What?
 Oh, okay, wild adventure. Oh, frenzy stance isn't working, die you undead mummy, die!
 Thank you.
 That's on the registration?
 Ooh, awesome, okay, I totally like to initiate I'm a big old five.
 Sheldon, what do you want.
 Yeah, Hi, listen, as long as I'm here, I'm on a quest with a bunch of noobs, they don't know what they're doing, we've got one assassin, three spellcasters and no tank.
 No, no, no, no, I need you now.
 Whatever, I'll figure it out myself.
 Who are you?
 Yeah, sure, why not?
 Oh my God, I need help. 
 I'm the dumplings.
 Creepy, Howard.
 Sit over there.
 What do you have….
 I thought the blowers were more sanitary?
 Gosh, Raj, do you think you'll ever be able to talk in front of me without being drunk? Okay, well, I'll just, um, go eat by myself.
 No, it's okay, between him not talking,  him talking and… him, I'm better off alone, so,  goodbye you poor strange little man.
 Here you go, Raj, you might want to drink this one slowly.
 What are you guys talking about?
 And you guys aren't going? I can't believe you, Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you're not even going to be there to support him?
 Come on, this is huge, Raj is going to be in People magazine. And he didn't even have to knock up one of the Spears sisters.
 Of course I would, I would be honoured.
 Shame on you guys.
 Oh, Raj, look at you!
 Um, yeah, starting with the champagne a little early aren't you?
 Oh, I'm ready.
 Um, yeah, why what's wrong with it?
 Yeah, well, this is all the donkulous you're gonna get.
 Hey Leonardrd.
 Thank you.
 Uh, come on, good night Leonardrd.
 Alright, come on, come on.
 Yes, it's very nice, goodnight Raj.
 Yes it is.
 Oh, wow, is the evening over.
 Wait, meet them.
 I am not your squeeze. There is no squeezing.
 No, no, there's no sowing, no squeezing, and no sucking face.
 I don't know, maybe it's the local cuisine. Okay, well, it's nice to meet you, just gonna set you on down over here, and I'm going to leave so, Namaste.  And FYI, you'd be lucky to have me as a daughter-in-law.
 Raj, what are you doing. No. No notes. If you have something to say to me, say it.
 Oh, sweetie, it's okay.
 Sheldon, what is it?
 Thanks for the update.
 Yeah, uh, I really don't think I do.
 Yeah, honey, you'll be fine as long as you don't do that bungee cord thing, okay?
 Yes, Sheldon, we are friends.
 Oh, dear God.
 You know this is my day off, Sheldon.
 Mm-hmm.
 It's fine, it's been on for, like, a month.
 Sheldon, it's fine.
 Uh, maybe the light's broken.
 What?
 Do you have any alcohol?
 Too bad.
 Mm-hmm.
 Well, good for Leonardrd.
 No.
 No.
 How about we just have a little quiet time now?
 Get out.
 I said, get out.
 Good morning.
 Sheldon, you know  that we care about you.
 You're hurting the people around you, sweetie.
 All right, come on Sheldon.
 What?
 Okay.
 Fine.
 All right! 
 Yeah, and I never wanted to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts. You know, I gotta ask, why didn't you just get a license at 16 like everybody else?
 Doing what?
 Well, how 'bout when you were 17?
 Sheldon, it's C, just put down C.
 Come on, let's go.
 I'll hit you in the face with a pillow.
 Oh.
 Oh God, wait, slow, hit the brakes, hit the brakes!
 Oh, yeah, no, this thing's majorly out of order. See? Sorry.
 Where you going?
 Oh, are you here to see Leonardrd?
 Dr. Sheldon Cooper?
 Sheldon Cooper? Tall, thin, looks a little like a giant praying mantis?
 Sheldon Cooper?
 I need to see this.
 Oh, come on, we'll be quiet.
 Okay, you guys, look, I know this is none of my business, but I just, I have to ask, what's Sheldon's deal?
 You know, like what's his deal? Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?
 Come on, everybody has a deal.
 I'm sorry?
 Okay, well, thanks for the nightmares.
 What are you guys gonna do?
 Yeah, I'm busy, so, goodnight.
 Hey, guys, this package came for y…
 Sorry. Holy crap on a cracker.
 Hi. You know, you probably don't want to go in there.
 You know, the only way I could explain it would be in a therapist's office with dolls.
 Sheldon, honey, I've told you, it's a small apartment, you only have to knock one time.
 Get rid of her how?
 Excuse me?
 Okay, first of all, it is not man after man.
 Hide you?
 Oh, man.
 Really? Well, then will you explain it to me?
 Uh, yeah, no, that's not it.
 Oh, gee, okay.
 Yeah, he's a gift all right.
 Um, sure, sisters.Holy crap on a cracker.
 Oh, hey, hi.
 Sisters?
 Hey, guys, I need to use your TV.
 I don't know, it just died, I'm getting a bunch of static.
 You sound just like the cable company. All right, so, shh, Tyra Banks is about to kick someone off  America's Next Top Model.
 Fine.
 Oh. That's Anais, none of the other girls in the house like her.
 They all live in a house together.
 I don't know. Somewhere in L.A.
 Yeah, I guess.
 To pay my cable bill.
 Hey, guys, what'd I miss? What'd I miss?
 Oh, good, I hate her.
 Thank you.
 Oh, Giselle's not getting kicked off. It's totally going to be Summer. What?
 It's one onion ring.
 I don't know. I was hungry? What's the big deal?
 All right. Look, I didn't know, I'm sorry.
 What?
 A sports metaphor?
 All right, yeah, I'll play along. What was my first strike?
 I did?
 Oh, come on, everybody loves LOLcats. They're cute and they can't spell 'cause they're cats.
 Come on, I touched one onion ring.
 Oh, honey, the buses don't go where you live, do they?
 Well, what a thrill.
 Oh, jeez, you've got to be kidding me.
 I don't care. I'm taking a stand. Metaphorically.
 Ooh, strike three.
 I'm banished? What the hell kind of crap is that?
 Yeah, you do that.
 Okay, let me guess. A quesadilla with soy cheese for the lactose-intolerant Leonardrd.
 Shrimp Caesar salad with no almonds for the highly allergic kosher-only-on-the-high-holidays Howard, and for our suddenly back on the Hindu wagon Raj, meatlover's pizza, no meat. Coming right up.
 Oh, I didn't tell you? You're banished from the Cheesecake Factory.
 Well, you have three strikes. One, coming in. Two, sitting down. And three, I don't like your attitude.
 Yeah, no, there's a new policy. No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon.
 Hi.
 Really? Well, that's great.
 What? I'm not going to apologize to that nutcase.
 Leonardrd, don't you get it? If you guys keep going along with his insanity, you're just encouraging him.
 Look, I like hanging out with you guys, but I'm not going to apologize for something I didn't do.
 That's strike one, Leonardrd.
 There you go, quesadilla, salad, there's your pizza, and thanks to Sheldon's heated discussion with my manager one barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.
 Go ahead, eat it. I dare you
 Okay, where is he?
 Here. Try and go online.
 No, just try.
 Well?
 No, no, no, no, no. It is on. I am gonna introduce your friend to a world of hurt.
 I don't care, I was in junior rodeo, I can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds.
 Time to do your laundry, huh?
 I know. Every Saturday at 8
 I'm implying that you're a creature of habit, and if something were to prevent you from doing your laundry on Saturday at 8
 Oh, no, are all the machines taken? What are you gonna do?
 Another night? Well, I guess you can try, but deep inside your heart you'll know that laundry night is always Saturday night.
 Yeah, well, your ken can kiss my Barbie.
 Sheldon, Sheldon, Sheldon.
 Where are my clothes?
 Yes, I left them in the washers and when I went down to get them, they were gone.
 Sheldon, where are my clothes?
 How the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire?
 Get them down.
 Never.
 Look, wait, Sheldon, this has gotten out of hand, okay? I've done some stupid things, you've done some stupid things, how about we just call it even and move on with our lives?
 Look, you've got to meet me halfway here.
 Leonardrd, remember when I said it was on? Well, now it's junior rodeo on.
 Telephone wires can't electrocute you, can they?
 Oh, no, no, no. It is just beginning.
 What's this?
 Oh, my God.
 Look, I said I wanted to hurt him, but, but this?
 Can I sit wherever I want? No, no, never mind, never mind, that's, that's not important. Sheldon, this was big of you. Thank you. I really appreciate it.
 Good night, Sheldon.
 Yes?
 Thank you.
 Understood.
 Howard, your scooter's blocking my car. Aw, did you get pinkeye again?
 Yeah, just move your stupid scooter before I pick it up and throw it in the dumpster.
 Howard, didn't you say you worked on the Mars Rover?
 Yeah, when we first met, you said that if I went out with you, I could drive a car on Mars.
 No. Yeah, I remember specifically. You started by asking if I was from Mars because my ass was out of this world.
 Okay, where is he going?
 Oh, hey.
 New shirts?
 Nice.
 So, who's the girl?
 Well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating.
 Well, yeah, we did have a date.
 So, who is she?
 Oh, nice. A doctor doctor, or a you kind of doctor?
 Well, that depends.
 Is that friend Wolowitz?
 Screw him. You're fine.
 Well, have you slept with her yet? You dog! Good for you.
 No.
 I'm nosy. See ya.
 Hey, Sheldon.
 I'm sorry?
 What's wrong with you? you're freaking me out.
 Please don't do that.
 So, this wasn't the awkward part?
 Oh, all right. S'u'up?
 Okay, feeling the awkward now.
 Yeah, Leonardrd told me.
 To you?
 Well, what about me?
 Well, aren't you sweet?
 Yeah, I think she's pretty safe.
 Really?
 I could think about you.
 Always nice talking to you, Sheldon.
 What?
 This is a door knob.
 Sheldon, would you like to come in?
 No.
 Sheldon, what do you want?
 He's having problems with Stephanie?
 What?
 We never got to the bedroom.
 Oh, okay, all right, you know what? I'll tell you what happened. We were young, we were very much in love, but we could only communicate through a time-traveling mailbox at my lake house.
 What?
 Oh, thank you.
 No.
 Well, thank you.
 Yes.
 What?
 Leonardrd, congratulations.
 Your facebook status update. Leonardrd Hofstadter is in a relationship.
 Seriously? You went first, after only two weeks? That's bold.
 Well, then who did?
 What's wrong, Lassie? Timmy fall down the well? Oh, wow. She just updated her facebook status.
 Out of coffee. Need coffee.
 Hi! Stephanie, right?
 I'm Penny, I live across the hall. I've heard a lot about you.
 Mm-hmm.
 Nice to finally meet you, too.
 So, that's Stephanie, huh?
 You know, she seems very nice.
 Roommate? You guys are living together?
 Are you sure?
 Well, let's find out.
 Oh, sweetie, you'd be the last one to know about it. Hmm, cute dresses. I bet this looks great on you!
 Okay, hmm, scented candles, fuzzy slippers, ooh, floral bed sheets?
 Okay, moving on. Now, who are these guys at Disney World?
 You're going to go down swinging, huh? All right, well, we got your body lotion, your InStyle Magazine, your jewellery box.
 You have a Bat Signal?
 Really? What was your first clue?
 Oh hey.
 Yeah, sure. What are you washing? A crocodile?
 Oh, sweetie, you can't machine wash these. They'll be ruined.
 Absolutely.
 Are you guys having problems?
 Really?
 Okay, Leonardrd, honey, you know, if you're uncomfortable with the way things are going, you're allowed to say something.
 Believe me, your feelings are just as important as hers.
 Just tell her you need the relationship to move at a pace that you both are comfortable with.
 Sure.
 You're kidding, right?
 Go! Wow.
 Hey. Oh, I put your clothes in the dryer.
 Your pants are ruined.
 So, how did the talk with Stephanie go?
 So, you told her you wanted to slow things down?
 Good, good. And then what?
 You had sex, didn't you?
 Nothing. Okay, well, it sounds like things are going to work out.
 Come on, Leonardrd, you are entitled to try and make things go the way you want them to.
 Yes, you don't always have to go along with what the woman wants.
 What?
 Well, it's a chance you have to take. I mean, look, if it's meant to be, it'll be.
 I don't know. I mean, what have women said to you when they wanted to slow a relationship down?
 Yeah, that'll slow it down.
 Sheldon?
 Okay?
 Okay, let me check.
 Hiney?
 Hey, Sheldon, are you and Leonardrd putting up a Christmas tree?
 Saturnalia?
 Okay, well, thank you for that, but I got you and Leonardrd a few silly neighbour gifts, so I'll just put them under my tree.
 Uh-huh.
 I don't know. ‘Cause it's Christmas?
 Now, honey, it's okay.You don't have to get me anything in return.
 Okay, you know what? Forget it. I'm not giving you a present.
 Sheldon, I am very, very sorry.
 Oh, hey, Leonardrd. Ooh, are you okay?
 My God, how fast were you going?
 Hi. Penny. So it's your motorcycle?
 Oh, is it okay?
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. So, um, Dave, how do you know Leonardrd?
 Ha-ha. No, you're not.
 Uh, well, it's just that the physicists I know are indoorsy and pale.
 So, are you and Leonardrd working on an experiment together?
 Uh, sweetie, sweetie, Dave was talking. You know, I love science.
 Since always. Call me a geek, but I am just nuts for the whole subatomic particle thing.
 Ha. Well, that's what I am, queen of the nerds.
 You know, I have always wanted to see a big science lab.
 Since always.
 Um,yeah, yeah, that sounds great, let me just get my jacket.
 Okay. Let's go.
 Hey, Leonardrd. Dave was just showing me around the university. You know, this place is unbelievable!
 I never said that.
 Oh, shut up!
 Really? We're going to do an experiment?
 It's not an experiment! You saw what happened last night.
 Yeah. Oh, can I drive the motorcycle?
 Why are you yelling at me?
 Dave is not smarter than you. He's an idiot.
 Because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend.
 That's what you took from that? The guy is married!
 And you, if you are so okay with the way things are between us, why are you so jealous?
 Nice save, genius. Eggnog?
 It's just rum. It stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago.
 Smoother than you.
 Okay, Merry Christmas.
 Merry Christmas.
 How's your leg?
 Okay, here.
 Turn it over.
 Yeah, he came into the restaurant. Sorry the napkin's dirty. He wiped his mouth with it.
 Well, yeah, yeah, I guess. But look, he signed it.
 Okay, all I'm giving you is the napkin, Sheldon.
 Here. Open it.
 Yeah, and I checked. Not letting the bike fall on you while standing still is lesson one.
 Okay. 101 Totally Cool Science Experiments for Kids.
 Sheldon! What did you do?!
 Leonardrd, look! Sheldon's hugging me.
 No, I think I'm just going to stay in tonight and do laundry.
 Leonardrd?
 What the hell?
 Yeah, well, it almost killed me.
 So, who exactly does it want to kill?
 You know, since I moved last year, not all my mail has been forwarded.
 How is it supposed to be a dance if I'm the only girl?
 You're a pig, Howard.
 Our tango?
 Look, normally I can just ignore you. I mean, I get it, you're a little peculiar. You know, like Sheldon.
 Yeah, you might be right. But back to you. I know you think you're some sort of smooth-talking ladies' man, but the truth is, you are just pathetic and creepy.
 I am saying it is not a compliment to call me doable. It's not sexy to stare at my ass and say, “Ooh, it must be jelly 'cause jam don't shake like that.” And most important, we are not dancing a tango, we're not to'ing and fro'ing. Nothing is ever going to happen between us. Ever.
 Flirting? You think I'm flirting with you? I am not flirting with you, no woman is ever gonna flirt with you, you're just gonna grow old and die alone.
 Well, someone had to say it. What?
 Hey.
 Yeah, come on in. What's up?
 Get out.
 Well, then have the robot go and get him.
 His feelings needed to be hurt.
 Yeah, probably with a blow-up doll.
 Oh, please, how could I possibly devastate Howard?
 What does that mean?
 I turn into a bear?
 And say what? That I didn't mean it, because I meant it.
 Oh, pthththth.
 Okay, come on, that's not fair.
 Fine, I'll go over there tomorrow.
 What about her?
 Hey.
 So, I just came by to see how you were doing.
 Good. Your mom seems nice.
 Okay, look. Howard, I just want to apologize for some things that I have said. About you. I've been informed that you have feelings. And apparently, I have hurt them. So, I'm sorry. Howard.
 So, you're okay?
 Okay. Well, bye. So close.
 Aw, that sounds sweet.
 Oh, it's cute.
 That's great.
 Oh, it's fun.
 Howard, do you think maybe sometimes you try too hard?
 Well, you'd have a terrific chance. I mean, you're smart, you're funny, you have a cool job. You build stuff that goes into outer space.
 Look, I'm telling you, I've known you for, like, a year and a half and this is the first time I feel like I'm talking to a real person. And you know what? I like him, he's a nice guy.
 Yes.
 I do.
 He slipped and fell.
 Yes, now he knows what bathtubs are capable of doing when you don't treat them with respect.
 Sheldon, honey, aren't you getting a little carried away? I mean, it's just a toy robot.
 I know, I got it. Sheldon, I'm sorry.
 Thanks! I mean the e-mail doesn't bother me as much as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.
 What's up with Ichabod?
 Oh really? Well, good for him.
 Well, how did you guys become friends?
 And you moved in anyway?
 Well, what about Howard and Raj, I mean how did you become friends with them?
 Well yeah, sure. When you put it that way. But it all worked out, right?
 Oh come on, really? 
 Hello Sheldon.
 What is this?
 Yes. Well, that is a good question. But is this really the best way to figure it out?
 Okay, question 1. Rank the following aspects of Sheldon Cooper in order of appeal. Intelligence. Ruthless attention to hygiene. Playfulness. Java applet writing?
 Wait! How many questions are on this thing?
 Thanks pal.
 Sheldon honey, did you ever consider making friends by being, I don't know, pleasant?
 Sheldon, are you okay?
 Okay. You know what? I see where this is going. I'm not one of you guys. I'm not a scientist. So just…
 Eww.
 Penny.
 Ooh, ooh, shut the door, shut the door.
 Just do it! Get inside and shut the door.
 Is Leonardrd around?
 The building manager's showing an apartment downstairs, and I haven't paid my rent.
 It's no big deal. I'm just a little behind on my bills because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down.
 Well the “check engine” light is fine. It's still blinking away. It's the stupid engine that stopped working. It cost me like twelve hundred dollars to fix it.
 Yes, it occurs to me, too.
 Wow, you got a lot of money in there.
 Don't be silly.
 No, I can't.
 Well, yeah, but…
 But what if you need it?
 Really? I mean, are you sure?
 Are they working on that?
 Okay. Well, thank you. Oh, God, no, I can't. Sheldon honey, I don't want things to be weird between us.
 I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
 I'm regretting this already.
 Great. I hope I'm a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.
 No.
 Yes.
 Oh, thanks. This must be the beret I ordered. A couple of months ago. It was back-ordered.
 Okay, whatever. It's not like I'm running up and down the streets just buying myself berets. I bought one, like, a month ago, and it was back-ordered, look, it finally arrived, all right?
 Oh, my God, would you just get off my case?
 Thank you, Leonardrd. What's my share?
 No, really, how much?
 Well, which is it, ten or eleven?
 What?
 What are you saying? That I'm using my body to get dinner? That I'm some kind of Chinese food prostitute?
 ‘Cause let me tell you something, buddy, I pay my own way in this world, okay? I don't rely on anybody! What was that about?
 Here, Leonardrd, ten, eleven, twelve, uh, fourteen dollars.
 Yes, dinner's here, and I'm having some. I'm having takeout food.
 You're damn right it's okay. I've been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days, and I wanted something different. So sue me.
 Sheldon, look, I will pay you back as soon as I can. You just have to give me more time.
 She needed money. You seem under pressure. Did I not lend you a sufficient amount? Because I can give you more.
 Oh, you know, you would just love that, wouldn't you? Yeah. You would just love to open up your little snake can and throw some money at the girl who can't pay her bills.
 Going home, where I won't be interrogated like a criminal. I forgot my fortune cookie.
 Hey.
 Yeah. When I didn't pay my bill, the Department of Water and Power thought I would enjoy the ambience.
 I used Sheldon's money to pay my rent, then I had like fourteen dollars left over.
 Put it back in your pocket, or I'll find some other place to put it.
 Yeah, well, that's not really my big problem.
 Yeah, I know, it's just, this wasn't the plan, it wasn't supposed to go this way.
 Um, waitress for six months and then become a movie star.
 TV star.
 Oh, no, I can't give up my acting classes. I'm a professional actress.
 That is not the definition of professional.
 Oh, that's nothing.
 Well, remember Kurt?
 Yeah. He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.
 He was drunk.
 Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant, so I, you know, I paid his fines.
 No, but he will.
 Leonardrd, I'm not gonna call up Kurt and ask him for money.
 I don't know, but I may have to find a cheaper place to live.
 Why not?
 Well, do you know anybody?
 Oh, Leonardrd, honey, if we started living together, I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off you.
 And you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money.
 Hey, is Sheldon here?
 Nice hat.
 Maybe if you're working on a tuna boat.
 Sheldon, here is your money. Thank you very much. It helped a lot.
 No.
 Well, I cut back my expenses like you said and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant, but the biggest thing was, out of the blue, Kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me.
 Yes, he said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right.
 Nope. I just think he's really changed. We're having dinner tomorrow night, and I get to wear my new beret. Bye, guys.
 Fellas, please.
 You found it. It's the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower.
 What's that about?
 It's out of order.
 I think it implies that the elevator doesn't work.
 You must be Leonardrd's mother.
 Uh, I'm Penny. I'm his neighbour.
 Oh, nice to meet you.
 Uh, why don't you come with me. I'll walk you to the apartment.
 Yeah, sure, I guess.
 Okay. You know, I've always been curious. What was Leonardrd like when he was little?
 Right, okay. What was he like when he was young?
 Oh, um, okay, like, five or six. Five.
 Yeah, Leonardrd mentioned you were a psychiatrist.
 Oh, well, I'm an actress.
 What do you mean why?
 Yeah, I don't know what that means.
 Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood.
 I know my dad wanted a boy. I just, I tried being good at sports, but I hated getting dirty!
 Uh-huh, he called me Slugger until I got my first training bra, and then he just stopped playing catch with me. I wasn't Slugger anymore. Your mother's here!
 Hey.
 Your mom still here?
 Come on in. Wait, wait, she's not gonna come here looking for you, is she?
 Oh, my God. What happened?
 Geez, what a fun couple.
 Hey, I talked to her for five minutes yesterday and I've been half bombed ever since.
 My head, what about yours?
 She was right, you know. The locus of my identity is totally exterior to me.
 I mean, do you know where I was all morning? Auditioning with 50 other blondes for some stupid antidepressant commercial. And for what? So I'll finally get my daddy's approval?
 No, they said I was too perky.
 Yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn't let go. Your mother told me.
 A hugging machine?
 Oh, that is so sad.
 What?
 Okay, now this time…
 You're gonna lick the salt off my neck, do the shot, and then bite the lime.
 Neck, shot, lime. Okay, shot, lime.
 Honey, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.
 Why would you bring that up right now?
 So you're saying you're not having sex with me, you're having sex with your mother?
 That is the sickest thing I've ever heard.
 Get out!
 Oh, good morning.
 Look, I was just coming over to talk to you.
 Gotcha.
 I mean, my mom could've just said, “Bob, get over it, she's a girl, move on.” But she didn't. Not one word.
 Would it help?
 The whole thing froze. I don't know what happened.
 How can I calm down? I'm gonna lose my whole shopping cart. That's three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell.
 Hello, Sheldon.
 Are you planning on sitting here?
 Then what difference does it make?
 What?
 Fine. Happy?
 Boy, I love him, but he is one serious wackadoodle.
 Oh, thank you. You are a lifesaver.
 Yeah, you know the sad thing is, it's really not. Ooh, is this one of those paintball guns?
 Oh, no, thanks. I'm from Nebraska. When we shoot things, it's because we want to eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone.
 You think he'll notice?
 Oh, what are we gonna do?
 Why do we have to tell him I did it?
 Okay, okay, how about this? We tell him somebody broke in.
 I'm sorry, I buy it. All those people are on drugs.
 Okay, fine. Well, what if we just flip it over? There. Looks fine, right?
 Oh, come on. There, butt print.
 Thank you.
 Shh! Act normal.
 You know, I gotta go home and wash my hair.
 Here we go.
 Sheldon, I am really, really sorry, but it's only for a week. Can't you be a little bit flexible? Yeah, sorry. I didn't really think that through.
 Why not?
 His right hand is calling him?
 No. Not at all.
 Here you go. Fresh from the cleaners, good as new.
 Come on, Sheldon. Just give it a try.
 There, nice and comfy cosy. Zero, zero, zero.
 Sit on the damn couch.
 What do you mean, nope? What's wrong with it?
 It's exactly the same…
 You did make that up, right?
 Thanks for the shoes.
 What the hell?
 Screw that. 
 Here you go, Leonardrd. Is this going to be big enough?
 Oh, I love San Francisco. I wish I was going with you.
 When I go, I usually just get hammered and ride the cable cars.
 Oh, my God, the George Smoot?
 Of course I haven't.
 It's kind of a funny name, though, Smoot.
 Okay, now that I've been completely insulted, have a good flight.
 Oh, cool.
 Well, then why are you doing it?
 Yeah, we're putting the play on for one night in this little 99-seat theatre. Can you come? Oh, great. Do you know 98 other people that might want to come? Oh, hang on. Hello?
 Just a sec. The theatre is above a bowling alley, so it's a little noisy, but it might be the only chance I'll ever get to play Anne Frank. And the director is brilliant. He uses the bowling sounds as, like, Nazi artillery. Okay, great, I'll see you then. Hello?
 Your dresser? Who is this?
 Oh, hey, Sheldon! How is San Francisco?
 Uh, no, I was talking to my friend, but what's up?
 Hey, Leonardrd. What's going on with Dr. Wackadoodle?
 Oh, hang on, Sheldon, getting another call.
 Okay, I got a box, but there's no key in here. Just letters.
 Oh, Sheldon, are these letters from your grandmother?
 Oh, look, she calls you Moon Pie. That is so cute.
 Hey, Leonardrd. How's the train ride?
 Okay, yeah, I kind of crossed a line. Put him back on.
 What up, Moon Pie?
 Okay, I found the box. Now what?
 Hang on. Sheldon, do you have any emotional attachment to this box?
 Not yet. There it is.
 Hey, Sheldon.
 I know. You're safe.
 Oh, great, my rhinestones. Thank you.
 What?
 What is it?
 Sheldon, it's just a box of rhinestones.
 It means nothing to anybody. Come here, let me show you what I'm doing.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, look, look! I started a business.
 No, I'm making flower barrettes. See? I call them Penny Blossoms. I made one for myself, then all the girls at work wanted one. Then I showed some to this lady who runs a shop in Old Town. She sells cards and homemade jewellery. She said she wanted to sell them. I said okay, and in one week, I made a $156.
 Sheldon, don't you get it? If this takes off, I won't have to be a waitress anymore.
 Another waitress.
 I don't know.
 Nancy. Her name is Nancy.
 Sheldon, I'm sorry about your hamburger, okay? I just don't want to be a waitress for the rest of my life.
 Fine, cheeseburger.
 So, what do you think? I mean, this could be a business, right?
 About twenty.
 I don't know, like, 50 cents. I'm not sure.
 That's all?
 Well, I don't have to pay taxes on this stuff.
 And you know about that stuff?
 Who's Radiohead?
 Sheldon, hold on. Could you maybe show me how to make more money with this?
 Sheldon, wait! Will you?
 Yes.
 I understand.
 Okay.
 Oh, imagine that.
 No, sorry. Wait! Please come back!
 There. Done.
 Pretty good, right?
 A day?
 That just can't be right.
 No, sorry.
 Oh, God, no, no. Just please tell me what to do about it.
 Okay, you know what, if I'm not allowed to be snide, you're not allowed to be condescending.
 All right, fine. How are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment?
 Hello.
 Yeah, it's crazy, but it totally works. Look, we made this Penny Blossom in under three minutes.
 Well, there are the waitresses at my work, and this cute, little shop in Old Town.
 Yeah, it's a bitch.
 Ew.
 I've got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen.
 Well, what's wrong with my apartment?
 Wait, wait, what am I going to do?
 Oh, okay, cool. I'm going to take a nap.
 Uh, well, it's a little juvenile. I mean, it kind of looks like the MySpace page of a 13-year-old girl.
 We do?
 No kidding. Two?
 Thank you, Penny Blossoms. These will be perfect to cover my bald spot. Aww, that is so sweet.
 How are flower barrettes going to appeal to men?
 Wait a minute, wait a minute, you want to make a hair barrette with Bluetooth?
 Get out! Who needs a thousand sparkly flower barrettes with rhinestones?
 Wait, wait, wait, why does it say one-day rush? Since when do we offer a one-day rush?
 Yeah, but they don't have to glue the books together. How the hell are we going to make a thousand Penny Blossoms in one day?
 Okay, well, I'm gonna have to call them and cancel the order.
 I just don't see how see can pull this off.
 You guys get started.
 Going online to buy shoes!
 So?
 Nicely done.
 Someone's in the kitchen with Dinah… Sheldon? Sheldon!
 Honey, do you want some coffee?
 Come on, but if you don't stay awake we'll never finish in time.
 Leonardrd, help.
 Leonardrd?
 Here, this will help.
 We should have let him go to bed.
 I just want you guys to know I am really grateful for your help, and for every dollar I make, I'm going to give you 20 cents.
 Oh. Then never mind.
 What?
 Really?
 Okay, well. Guess we'd better get started.
 Come on. What about the living organism of the workforce and the American spirit and Jiminy Crockett at the Alamo?
 Yes, yes, I know that, okay? I'm tired, I've had like 18 cups of coffee. The point is, if we all just pull together, we can do this. Who's with me?
 Leonardrd?
 We're all out.
 Okay, it's done. Look, guys, for the future, I don't mind killing the big spiders, but you have to at least try with the little ones.
 Not with a thousand condoms, Howard.
 Okay, new topic, please. Hey, did you hear the people upstairs in 5A are moving out?
 The people upstairs are moving out.
 How else was I supposed to say it?
 Sheldon, I'm sure it's going to be fine.
 Okay, honey, did you even know the people that are moving out?
 Well, I'm sure the new people will be just as quiet.
 You're right, I can't. You know what? Anyone could rent that apartment now, an opera singer, the cast of stomp, yeah, a tap-dancing pirate with a wooden leg.
 I tried making it better, he wouldn't go for it.
 The horror!
 Oh, hey, guys.
 Hi.
 I can see.
 Oh, yeah, I don't usually dress like this. I'm going jogging.
 I can start.
 Thank you, Sheldon.
 Oh, yeah, be careful.
 Okay.
 See ya. I'm dressed like a slob today, too.
 Hey.
 Well, sort of.
 I bought new clothes, okay? Is Leonardrd around?
 Oh. all right, that's cool, no biggie. He said he'd help me set up my printer, but I guess I can wait. What exactly is he doing up there?
 Oh, they're all up there, huh? Hmm, typical.
 Okay, now I see the giant squid head.
 Hello?
 Hey, I just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift.
 Great.
 Oh, this? I'm dressed like a slob today.
 Yeah.
 That is so awesome.
 Yeah, I know, tell me about it.
 That's why I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I'm holding out for the right part.
 Uh, hey, guys, guys, you will really appreciate this, I read the best science joke on the internet. Alicia, you won't get it, but it's right up their alley. Anyway, so, this physicist goes into an ice cream parlour every week and orders an ice cream sundae for himself, and then offers one to the empty stool sitting next to him. This goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he's doing. The man says, “well, I'm a physicist, and quantum mechanics teaches us that it is possible for the matter above this stool to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman who might accept my offer and fall in love with me.” The owner then says, “well, lots of single, beautiful women come in here every day, why don't you buy an ice cream for one of them, and they might fall in love with you?” And the physicist says, “yeah, but what are the odds of that happening?”
 How would I know? I'm not even sure I get it.
 Uh, hey, maybe when you're done with her printer, you could set up mine. You know, like you promised a week ago.
 Well, they're all still up there.
 I don't even know why I care. I don't care. All right, I cared enough to memorize that stupid joke, but that's all I care.
 What are you saying, that I'm threatened by Alicia? That I'm like the old queen of the hive and it's just time for me to go?
 Bees. Aaah! I just got that physicist joke.
 No, no occasion, just felt like getting some Chinese chow for my peeps.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes
 So, what do we got going on tonight, huh? Playing Halo watching Battlestar, drop some mentos in diet coke?
 What can I say? I got my geek on, boys.
 Oh, actually, that's okay. we already have…
 …chinese food right here.
 I cannot believe they're letting her just use them like that. I mean, anything she wants, they go panting after her like trained dogs. You know that just last week, she had Howard drive all the way to her uncle's house in Orange County to pick up her TV?
 Apples and oranges here, Sheldon. I'm telling you, that girl is a user, iceskating through the life on her looks, taking advantage of innocent weak-willed men, getting auditions for stupid network shows. It creams my corn.
 Please.
 Oh boy.
 Uh, no. No, no, no, you know, congratulations, I think you'll make a great hooker.
 Um, I don't know, I don't think a lot.
 Um, hey, hey, can I talk to you about that for a second?
 Well, you know, it's just that Leonardrd and Howard and Raj, they aren't like other guys. They're special.
 Oh, let's see, how can I explain this, um, they don't know how to use their shields.
 Yeah, you know, like in Star Trek, when you're in battle and you raise the shields? Where the hell did that come from? Anyways, um, you know how guys like this are, so, please don't take advantage of them.
 Come on, they're doing everything for you, because you're leading them on.
 Excuse me?
 Okay, lady, you are way out of line.
 Yeah, you're out of line.
 Thank you.
 Well, dead whore on TV, live one in real life.
 Oh hey, guys, where're you headed?
 You got me. While you're there, could pick me up a few comics for my nephew's birthday?
 Leonardrd, could you pick me up a few comics for my nephew's birthday?
 I don't know, he's 13. Just pick out anything.
 Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.
 Leonardrd?
 Ugh, that's what I was trying to avoid.
 Oh, what a cute, little store. Everybody's staring at me.
 Unlikely. Here, what about this one for my nephew?
 Oh, great.
 What's a multiverse?
 Thanks. He seems like a nice guy.
 No, no, no, I just meant for… yeah.
 What about the guy over there in the superhero T-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?
 Excuse me.
 Hi. What would you recommend as a present for a 13-year-old boy?
 Oh, Hellblazer. What's this about?
 Well, if that doesn't make me the favourite aunt, I don't know what will. Is this me?
 It's really good.
 That's so sweet, but what if I didn't like it?
 Okay, you've got my number, now, give me the picture.
 All right. So, um, just give me a call.
 Oh, hey guys.
 Uh, Stuart has a piece in an art show that's opening tonight.
 It's Friday night, that means Chinese food and vintage video games, right?
 Wow, Zork. Well, you guys have fun.
 Oh come on. I think it's nice that Captain Sweatpants showed up to your art opening.
 Um, you know, it's kind of early. Do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something?
 Oh, you think coffee, means coffee, that is so sweet. Come on, I think I have decaf.
 Sheldon, we're a little busy here, so…
 I'll just go look for it.
 I found the decaf!
 Hello, Sheldon.
 Great.
 Really? Are you drunk?
 That's Superman's big ice thing, right?
 Mmm, what smells so good?
 Yum. Well, enjoy your big evening.
 Have fun, Sheldon.
 What's wrong, Superman? Locked out of your big ice thingy?
 Hang on, I think the emergency key is around here somewhere.
 So, how did the beautiful mind of Sheldon Cooper forget his key in the first place.
 Oh-oh. I just remembered where the emergency key is.
 In your apartment.
 Well, I went in there a few weeks ago when you guys weren't home, and I forgot it there.
 It's not a big deal, I was making coffee and I ran out of milk.
 Alright, Sheldon, let's just calm down and we'll call the building manager, he'll come open your door, you just eat your dinner here while you're waiting.
 Yeah, why not?
 Are you trying to make small talk? Oh, sweetie, you really don't have to.
 Well, uh, they shifted my schedule around at the restaurant so my hours are going to be a little different…
 Oh, God, I don't know Sheldon, are you Star Wars?
 Okay, I give up, can we just do something else?
 What?
 Where did that even come from, did he say we were?
 No, just mail, no benefits.
 Why are you asking?
 Well, some people just can't handle that kind of relationship.
 Excuse me?
 Sheldon, I really don't want to talk about this with you.
 Of course it's making me uncomfortable, can't you tell?
 I'm uncomfortable, Sheldon!
 I don't think the manager's coming tonight so, here.
 Well, it wasn't the first suggestion that came to mind, but it's the one I'm going with.
 What?
 Oh, alright. I will give you my bed on one condition. That you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours.
 Only if it doesn't rhyme.
 What?
 Maybe that's because your hole is still open.
 Your home is twenty feet from here.
 Damn it. What do you want me to do
 That's only for when you're sick.
 Come on, do I really have to?
 Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, um…
 Sleepy ki…
 Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.
 Yeah.
 Oh, you're welcome sweetie.
 Hey, Leonardrd.
 How's it going?
 Fine. Oh, hey, can I ask you something?
 You know your friend Stuart?
 Well, he asked me out again and I said yes, and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.
 Well, does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? ‘Cause you know, you and me…
 Okay, well, that's really cool of you.
 Well, In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?
 He's very shy, how do I make him feel more comfortable around me?
 Really?
 Morning. What's up?
 Oh, no, thanks. I have coffee.
 I really don't want to talk about it.
 I said I don't want to talk about it.
 Look, Leonardrd, what goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business. So just leave it alone, okay?
 What's classified?
 Leonardrd, could you pass the soy sauce, please?
 Yeah, I said Leonardrd.
 What the hell is that?
 Sheldon.
 Sheldon.
Sheldon.
Sheldon.
 Sheldon.
Sheldon.
 What do you want?
 Now, honey, I already told you, the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature.
 What?
 You're all going?
 For three months?
 Excuse me.
 Hey, Leonardrd.
 Sheldon says you're going to the North Pole.
 Yeah. I'm just a little surprised you didn't tell me.
 Oh, hey, no, you don't have to apologize. There's no reason you have to tell me. I was just, you know, surprised.
 Is he serious?
 All right, I'll see what I can do. So, three months at the North Pole. Wow, that is awesome.
 Just a warning, Sheldon, the freezer locks from the outside.
 Hey, Leonardrd, can I talk to you for a sec?
 Well, I got you a little going away present.
 Oh, no, no, no, not just a blanket. See, it has sleeves. Yeah!  So, you can, you know, be all snoodled up while you do your science stuff.
 Oh, I'm gonna miss you. See you later.
 Oh, Leonardrd, what time is it?
 Okay.
 Um, I don't know. You'll be gone and I'll notice.
 Wine, credit card and late night television are a bad combination.
 That wasn't a long hug.
 Leonardrd, I don't know what to tell you. It was just a hug.
 Yeah.
 Okay, have a safe trip.
 Okay, bye.  Means I wish you weren't going.
