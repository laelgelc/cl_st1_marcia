 Oh, yeah. Yeah. I met her at Comic-Con, the one place in the world where saying I own a comic bookstore is an actual pickup line.
 Not really. She's horrible. When she wants to have sex, she puts on her plus-size Wonder Woman costume and shouts who wants to take a ride in my invisible plane?
 No, no, I can't.
 ‘Cause then I'd be alone, like you.
 Hey.
 You guys finally chip in for a bodyguard?
 Yeah, I work 70 hours a week and average a dollar sixty five an hour.
 Is that sarcasm?
 So are you guys coming to my New Year's Eve costume party?
 Than than Leonard in high-heeled boots? Howard's mother in high-heeled boots?
 And the award for best group costume goes to Justice League of America number three!
 Okay. Okay, ten seconds to midnight.
 Ten, nine, eight…
 Seven, six…
 Five, four, three…
 Two, one! Happy New Year!
 Um. Hi. I'm Stuart. I run a comic bookstore, which for financial reasons, I'm currently living in. And I guess what I'm hoping for most out of tonight is a hot shower.
 Can you please get back to the drunk girl? I'd like something to think about in the shower.
 And I'll take a shower. We'll meet back here in fifteen.
 Anybody do Walking on Sunshine yet?
 Dibs.
