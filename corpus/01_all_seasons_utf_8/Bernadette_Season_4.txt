 Hi, guys.
 I believe you were about to rip off my uniform with your teeth.
 Clearly you are. Otherwise, based on past experience, we’d be done by now.
 What’s George Takei doing here?
 She’s leaving because you really want to be with me.
 Sorry, I had to clock out.
 Okay. You know, busy, school, work. You?
 Too bad.
 Well, to be honest, I…
 I’m okay.
 No.
 No, it’s fine.
 What about you, have you been seeing anybody?
 So you’ve been seeing other girls?
 Does that mean slutty trolls?
 Thank you.
 I know. I work here.
 Howard, you did have a real woman. I was right there in the next room while you were clicking that troll’s brains out.
 Had sex?
 Well, whose fault was that?
 Well, we could’ve been having sex, but you never made the move.
 Howard, a girl doesn’t go out with a man like you, with your looks, your fancy patter and your tight hoochie pants if she’s not expecting him to eventually make the move.
 Really.
 Me, too.
 Mm! What are you doing?
 Oh, not now. We’re starting a new relationship. I need to get to know you again.
 Be patient, we’ll get there.
 Oh, I take pacts very seriously. One time at my lab, a petri dish of genetically modified super-virus went missing. That day we made a pinky swear never to admit we crossed Ebola with the common cold.
 We never did. That would be a terrible, terrible thing.
 Joy, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is Joy.
 Isn’t she a pip?
 I’ll go with you.
 Knock-knock.
 Olive.
 Oh, no. That movie has melting faces. It reminds me too much of the time I dropped that vial of flesh-eating bacteria into the Rhesus monkey lab. Besides, Penny and I are having a girls’ night tonight.
 Oh, you know, girls get together, hang out, share girl talk.
 Oh. Well, maybe you can join us. I’ll ask Penny.
 You are?
 Penny, your nails look great.
 Or we could just stay here.
 Gee, I don’t know if I should drink more. I have to drive home, and I’ve got enough trouble seeing over the dashboard as it is.
 Oh, you never were?
 You know what I really love about Howard? His chest hair.
 No, just the one. But it’s really long.
 Truth.
 Um.
 I thought it was pretty spicy. Especially the part where he kisses her nether yea.
 Okay, my turn. Penny, truth or dare?
 Why are you still hanging out with Leonard so much even though you broke up with him?
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 That one.
 She’s been in there a long time.
 Ooh, like what?
 Where exactly on the Internet have you been looking?
 I might have gone with eating raw cookie dough.
 Knock-knock.
 So where’s the telescope?
 So we just sit and stare at the screen, waiting for something to happen?
 Here we go.
 Hold on. Wait. No, it’s okay, go ahead.
 Oh, I was working with Penicillin-resistant gonorrhoea in the lab today and I was just trying to remember if I washed my hands.
 It won’t help. Once he finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it.
 Oh, right. Did you get your hair cut?
 Which is still so funny.
 Right. Help, I’m a prisoner in a Chinese fortune cookie factory.
 Howard, help me out of the tub! I’m stuck again!
 Well, live and learn. So, Raj, do you think this planet you’re looking for could have an atmosphere that supports life?
 That sounds great.
 He’s taking a turn to the dark side, isn’t he?
 Oh, you poor, poor thing. Raj, you have to know you’re a wonderful man. There are a lot of girls out there who’ll want to kiss you.
 You just have to look.
 Well, this was fun.
 Oh, thanks. Howard gave it to me. It’s the cutest thing. Every time I have dinner with his mom, the next day I get jewellery.
 Hi.
 He’s really cute. How do you know him?
 Yes.
 Couldn’t you just fool around with him and then listen to NPR?
 It’s what I do with Howard. I’m much smarter than he is. But it’s important to protect his manhood.
 What’s the matter?
 I hope we get there in time to see the keynote address.
 Yeah, it sounds fun. Super bacteria
 Really? And miss the keynote?
 Well honey, if you’re that tired, why don’t you just take a nap here in the car?
 Hang on. It’s Leonard. Hi, Leonard.
 Oh. Thank you, Raj.
 Don’t worry, Penny. This is a better car anyway.
 They say we’re young and we don’t know, we won’t find out until we grow.
 Babe, mm da-da, da-da, da-da, I got you, babe, da-da, da-da, da-da, I got you, babe…
 I got you, babe.
 Oh, my God, Glenn!
 Are you here for the conference?
 Oh, good for you. Uh, Glenn, this is my boyfriend Howard.
 I’ll try to catch it.
 Bye.
 Yeah?
 No. He was one of my professors in college.
 Then we went out for a year. Come on, let’s check in, so we can take that nap.
 Do we really need to talk about my old boyfriend now?
 Six-seven.
 Is something bothering you?
 What?
 Howard, it’s not a contest. I love you. I want to be with you.
 You can’t think that way.
 Howard, stop it.
 Wait a minute, a girl like me? What’s that mean?
 Are you saying you don’t think I’m hot enough to go out with a guy like Glenn?
 I’m too hot to go out with a guy like Glenn?
 Can I stay here tonight?
 Howard’s a complete and total ass.
 Thanks. I’ll sleep on the floor.
 Sure. I think all branches of science have to move cautiously these days. It’s not just giant nuclear weapons that can destroy the world. As a microbiologist, I can tell you even the tiniest organisms can still tear you a new one.
 I think Mr. Wolowitz needs to keep in mind that the past is the past. But he should know that I am the kind of girl who could get all the giant missiles she wants.
 Oh, come on, Howard, be realistic.
 Um, Penny, that’s Glenn. Glenn, that’s Penny.
 Are you guys doing okay?
 Well, that shouldn’t be too hard. He’s such a cutie.
 Don’t you listen to them. You’ve got plenty of sex appeal.
 Yeah. You’re a hottie.
 I have to stay here for school.
 Most of them regular, some of them kind of messed up.
 What do you say?
 Did you hear? Isn’t it terrible?
 They wouldn’t let me in. Oh my Howie.
 Sexually.
 That’s how I heard it.
 Okay, Raj, I know you’ve been avoiding me and Howard, and I’m not leaving until you tell me what’s going on inside that little head of yours.
 Like a hidden flower my sweet fragrance comes into view!
 My desert welcomes you like the rainy monsoon!
 My universe!
 My universe!
 My universe!
 Nothing. Just thinking about the noises people make during sex.
 It’s cute. You sound a little like a drunken monkey. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
 That’s how I take it.
 Me too.
 Oh! Already? Why don’t you stay over?
 Please, I think the woman can manage to put a wig on by herself.
 It’s just, when you leave right after we make love, it makes me feel cheap.
 Stay.
 Go home.
 Howard, have you ever considered us living together?
 No, I mean just you and me. You can move in here, or we can find a place.
 What?
 Great.
 Sure.
 That’s it? That’s your big solution to all of our problems? If your mom’s nose holds up, we get two nights together?
 No, it’s not great. You need to make a choice. Me or your mother.
 Wrong answer.
 I’m listening.
 Agh!
 Really?
 What did she say when you told her?
 This is so great. I love you, Howard.
 Well, I don’t really have much of anything in the house.
 Wow.
 I can’t believe we’re finally living together.
 What?
 No. I, I might have some cheddar.
 Okay.
 No.
 Wait a second. I’m doing your laundry?
 I have to take you?
 Wait a minute. Are you telling me your mother usually takes you to the dentist?
 I can’t believe this.
 All right, Howard, let’s get something straight right now. I’m not going to be your mother.
 Hi.
 We’re here to kidnap you for a girls’ night out.
 We just thought you might want to go out and have a good time, maybe go dancing.
 Sure.
 We were hoping you’d know a place.
 But you could if you wanted to, right?
 Pick out the hottest guy in the room, take him home, do unspeakable things to him, then kick him to the curb with a smile on his face and teeth marks on his heinie?
 I would take that deal all day long.
 What’s that?
 Oh, God, that is so romantic.
 Leonard’s really one of a kind.
 That’s kind of creepy.
 I feel like I’m supposed to say that bitch, but I don’t have enough information.
 I took Howard to the beach once. He almost burst into flames like a vampire.
 Oh. That bitch!
 Well, if it makes you feel any better, I’m never speaking to Priya again.
 I don’t have an urge to fling my waste.
 Count your blessings you’re not a Tanzanian chimp.
 Oh, hey, Raj, what are you doing here?
 Uh-huh. So, uh, Howard’s not here?
 Yeah.
 Oh, thanks.
 Oh, God. What’s happening?
 Howard, let me just stop you right here.
 Yes.
 Yes, I will marry you.
 I will. I will!
 Oh, I love you, too.
 Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars and pretended to be dragons.
 Ooh, the Priya bashing’s starting early. Yay! Okay, what’s up with those pantsuits?
 Whee-ee-ee!
 I do. Amy and Sheldon sitting in a tree. K-I-S-S-S-S-I-N-G.
 Not if they’re doing it for a long time.
 That doesn’t count. Aren’t you even a little curious?
 Oh, I totally want to see Sheldon dance. I bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate.
 Well, what does your cotillion training say is expected of a gentleman when three ladies ask him to escort them to a dance soiree?
 Muy caliente, Sheldon!
 Oh, I’m sorry, I’m engaged.
 Amy, you must’ve been in the bathroom with other women before.
 Some women don’t like to get chummy when their panties are down.
 We’re really not that close.
 Did I tell you Priya invited me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?
 You think?
 Well, what makes me the weakest member?
 It doesn’t matter. I’m going to tell her we can’t make it.
 I don’t understand. I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.
 I don’t know. I’m not a very good liar. They kind of whup that out of you in Catholic school.
 I don’t want anything in my ample bosom.
 That’s what I hear.
 She’s also dating an astronaut.
 Yeah. But Leonard’s impressive, too.
 I don’t know. The regular way people meet astronauts.
 Obviously, this one doesn’t.
 Leonard lives here. Priya’s from India. People meet, Howard. God!
 You’ve met lots of astronauts, and I’ve never grilled you about that. I’d thank you to extend me the same courtesy.
 Maybe that’s where she met the astronaut, all right?
 He’s a consultant.
 He can’t have a hobby? Excuse me, I have to pee. Or is that implausible, as well?
 I think they’re on to me. The story’s starting to fall apart.
 In the bathroom.
 They’re just asking me all sorts of questions I can’t answer.
 I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard going to India to meet Priya’s parents.
 They said something about going there this summer.
 I don’t know. I was too busy covering my heinie on Amy’s stupid astronaut story!
 You texted me Penny’s dating an astronaut.
 Yeah, it’s hysterical.
 I don’t want to do this anymore!
 It was an architect!
 Let me help you.
 This trip to India sounds fun.
 Are you concerned your parents might not approve of Leonard?
 Well, I wouldn’t worry about it. It’s not like you guys are getting engaged, right?
 Not engaged. Very interesting. I have to tinkle.
 Yes. Are you writing a book?
 I’m not upset. Maybe you’re upset.
 I can’t do this anymore! I’m a good girl! I went to Catholic school!
 You mean the one with my one hundred and eighteen-pound rock-hard stud of a fiancé who’s prone to canker sores and pinkeye?
 Do you want me to spill hot soup on her?
 I know. But if she orders something low-fat I’ll totally give her the full-fat version.
 You guys ready to order?
 I don’t understand.
 All right. Here you go. Two lemonades, one iced tea and a root beer for Priya.
 That’s what you ordered.
 Yeah. We’re thinking of having it on a cliff overlooking the ocean.
 He hasn’t told her yet. He’s waiting for the right time.
 You’re a real hero, Howard.
 So it’s probably genetic.
 What?
 Come on, Howard, I’m going to be your wife. You can share anything with me.
 You told her we were going to get married and she had a heart attack?
 You mean sexual intercourse?
 Howard’s mother had a heart attack because I have sex with him and she can’t.
 How can we be together if the thought of us getting married might kill your mother?
 Me? Why me?
 Okay, well, wish me luck.
 You’re a putz. You know what that means?
 Your mother just taught it to me. She thinks she got food poisoning from that deli and she just wanted to make sure I was okay.
 No, because I’m engaged to a putz. You let me believe I was the reason she had a heart attack.
 Shut up! She said I’m a wonderful girl and that you’re lucky to have me.
 To the toilet! Is that okay with you?
 Guys, sorry I’m late. I have amazing news.
 The thesis committee accepted my doctoral dissertation. I’m getting my PhD.
 Thank you.
 Well, you’ll be really be proud of this. I was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company. They’re gonna pay me a buttload of money!
 Well, there are a couple of opportunities available, but I volunteered for the premature ejaculation project. I mean, it’s not like either one of us has heart disease. Oh, I almost forgot. I got you a little present.
 I wanted to. Come on, open it.
 Oh, you let me worry about the money. I just want my baby to have pretty things.
