 Leonard, you're back.
 Hi!
 I missed you so much.
 I couldn't even think of anyone else while you were gone.
 Oh, this is ridiculous. What?
 It's great to see you too. Come on in.
 Okay, can someone please tell me what's going on here?
 Is that true?
 Why did you have to make him happy?
 Oh, the poor thing.
 Wait, wait. Aren't you going to go talk to him?
 No, you're right, you shouldn't talk to him. I will.
 Hey. Do you want to talk?
 Oh, hon ...  Uh ...  Soft kitty, warm kitty ... 
 Oh. Sorry. I don't know your sad song.
 Well, you know, I do understand what you're going through.
 Well, no, but when I was a senior in high school, one of my friends heard I was going to be named head cheerleader. Oh, I was so excited. My mom even made me a celebration pie. Then they named stupid Valerie Mossbacher head cheerleader. Big ol' slutbag.
 Well, they're pretty tasty.
 Look, Sheldon, I just don't think that the guys and Leonard really meant to hurt you. You know? They just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation. Okay, you know what it's like? Remember that scene in the new Star Trek movie when Kirk has to take over the ship, so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasn't true, like saying Spock didn't care his mom died?
 Hi.
 Oh, Leonard, you shouldn't have. Oh, boy! What is it?
 Are you serious?
 Oh, my God. That's the most romantic thing anyone's ever said to me that I didn't understand.
 So, how do you know he ran away?
 Well, Leonard, aren't you going to do something?
 Well, you're not gonna go with them?
 Well, wait a second, Leonard, come on, how can you not go? He's your best friend.
 No. I promise I will be here when you get back. Just go help Sheldon.
 Yeah. We waited a few months. We can wait a few more days.
 Go.
 Uh-huh.
 Sure.
 I don't know.
 Leonard?
 It's weird.
 What are they talking about?
 Okay, yeah, well, I'm just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere. Maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside.
 Ugh, I am so embarrassed!
 What did you tell them?
 Fine? You said it was fine?
 It was okay.
 Yeah, it's a perfectly good word. I mean, you put it in front of donkey and you really got something. All right, look, let's not overreact, you know? For a lot of couples, it takes time to get to know each other's rhythms. Learn what the other person wants and likes.
 No.
 You know, I think this is one of those things where talking about it is not going to make it better. Want a glass of wine?
 Okay. See, we should've done this last night, you know, have a little wine, take the edge off.
 Don't talk, just drink.
 Hit me.
 Peppermint schnapps.
 Because I like peppermint, and it's fun to say schnapps. Hey, Leonard?
 Schnapps.
 Oh, sweetie. You really can't hold your liquor, can you?
 Oh, hey, Sheldon. What you got there? A new comic book?
 What do you have a safe deposit box for?
 What, do they have Wii cricket now? That can't be very popular.
 Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'm not feeling so hot either.
 I don't know, empathy? Anyway, I'm just saying that you're feeling upset about something with  Howard, and I'm upset about something with Leonard.
 What's Mrs. Riley's chicken?
 Okay, forget the chicken.
 No, no. You may be right about me and Leonard.
 No, I mean, we can always go back to being friends.
 Oh, hey.
 Not a lot. Just that we always have the option of going back to being friends.
 I don't know. I mean, you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends.
 It would take the pressure off.
 So, we'll just be friends.
 Come here.
 Morning, Sheldon. Come dance with me.
 Why not?
 Are you fun in any of them?
 All right, want some French toast?
 Tell you what, next French Toast Day, I will make you oatmeal.
 A homunculus?
 Oh, you're my little homunculus.
 Sorry. Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?
 Yes, well, I want a boyfriend whose roommate isn't a giant pain in the ass.
 You know what, I give up. He's impossible.
 Okay, so Kim the night manager went on maternity leave, and her husband's name is Sandy, right? So get this, her replacement is a woman named Sandy whose husband's name is Kim.
 I know. What are the odds?
 Ooh, Sheldon, it's as if you don't think I'll punch you.
 Fine, whatever. Are you finished?
 Um, yeah, sure, thanks.
 Oh, man, did the Kiss Army repeal don't ask, don't tell?
 Oh, wow, you're actually going out like that?
 Uh, yeah, I think we'll pass.
 They're gonna get beaten up at Walgreens. Oh, sorry, Sheldon, I almost sat in your spot.
 Thank you.
 What's this cartoon called again?
 Anime. You know, I knew a girl in high school named Anna May. Anna May Fletcher. She was born with one nostril. Then she had this bad nose job and basically wound up with three.
 Oh, am I talking too much? I'm sorry. Zip.
 Yes please. Oh. Hey, Kim. Yeah, I ...  You know what, hold on, let me take this in the hall. You'll never guess who they got to replace you at work ... 
 Oh' my God, she didn't!
 Uh, sorry guys, that girl is freaky!
 Freaky.
 Yeah, freaky.
 Thank you.
 Of course.
 Mmm, these are so good
 What?
 well, my new bed got delivered, if you come over and put it together, you can stay at my place.
 Yeah, but if we stay there, we won't have to be quiet.
 Hi, guys. Hi, honey.
 You're boring people sweetie.
 So, what are you guys doing?
 Okay. What do you watch on Thanksgiving?
 Oh, you know, that reminds me, I usually go back to Nebraska for thanksgiving, but this year they're calling it off on account of my brother's trial.
 Oh, just a big misunderstanding. You know, you'd actually like my brother, he's kind of a chemist. Anyway, I was thinking I'd have thanksgiving here, and you are all invited.
 I guess I could serve both.
 Tur-briska-fil?
 Raj, what about you?
 Hard to believe, but go on.
 Ugh, fine. But the man really needs to work on his girl issues.
 Why doesn't he just get another job?
 Ah, it's nice having the place to ourselves, isn't it?
 Mm-hmm. Hey, want to get a little crazy?
 Let's slide over to Sheldon's spot a make out.
 Oh, God, how did he know?
 Yeah, maybe.
 Yes, we know.
 Hey, I happen to love this movie.
 Leonard, honey, you don't have to say thank you every time we have sex.
 Oh, kill me.
 See, if you had killed me when I said kill me, I wouldn't have had to hear that.
 Do something.
 That's great.
 Are we terrible people?
 Get him, bring him back.
 Yeah.
 Um, I have a question.
 Okay, I've got another question. When does this get fun?
 Which one?
 How could he ruin the game?
 Sheldon, that is incredible.
 Really? Oh, great. I mean, aw. Okay, I gotta go.
 Because the last me I didn't go, I ended up playing Mystic Warlords of Ka.
 Ba-eye.
 Wow, you really are a genius.
 You mean, like a pinky swear?
 Well, in the first grade, my friend Rosie and I made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie. You know, from Sesame Street?
 Then we found out we both wanted Ernie. We didn't speak again until middle school.
 The heart wants what the heart wants, Leonard.
 Okay, I don't know where you're going with this, but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have.
 And you thought a good time to bring this up be right after sex.
 I'm not hooking Wolowitz up with one of my friends.
 The problem isn't what's on the inside. It's the creepy candy coating.
 Oh, great thing about Ernie, was he never asked me for anything. He just gave.
 She's adorable,  Howard. I think you'll like her.
 No, I thought that would be a nice surprise for her.
 I just told her you're an aerospace engineer, you speak five languages ... 
 Right. Oh, and I told her you have an unhealthy attachment to your mother.
 I'm kidding.
 Yeah, well, it's your fault.
 What?
 Am I a matchmaker or what?
 Hey, guys. What you doing? Going out to discover electricity?
 Kite fighting?
 Oh, gee, sounds amazing, but, um, I've got some friends coming over. Not a big thing, we're just gonna watch the Nebraska game.
 I would've invited you, but I know you're not a football fan.
 Well, maybe we'll hang out later, you know, after everybody's gone.
 See ya.
 Hi.
 It was pretty good. We won.
 I'm glad to hear it.
 Oh, my god, no. Why would you ask that?
 Sure you have.
 Of course not.
 Leonard, look, if you want to meet my friends, that would be great. I just, you know, I didn't want you to be bored.
 Well, Because they're not genius scientists.
 Like who?
 Okay, great. Well, then why don't you come over next Saturday and watch the game with us.
 They have them every week.
 You wanted to meet my friends.
 Oh, that's okay, a lot of the guys' girlfriends don't know football. They just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen.
 Sweetie, that's a highlight from the '98 championship game.
 How much beer have you had?
 Oh. I was just kind of hoping you were drunk. Now we're back live.
 Here, have some pizza, sweetie.
 I know. I just need you stop talking.
 Sheldon, come in.
 There's some in the fridge.
 On Earth, we say thank you.
 You know, Leonard, honey, I wouldn't mind if you wanted to go fly kites with Sheldon.
 Until half time.
 And you're gonna be here for a couple more.
 No.
 So, yeah, anyway, that's my boyfriend. He is really smart.
 Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe you made up your own game.
 All right, five. One, two, three, four, five. Oh, wow, look at that, my Department of Defence research grant is renewed.
 Yay.
 Actually, I have to pick up my friend Justin from the airport.
 Um, yeah, if you want. I mean, there may not be room. He's got a lot of stuff, like guitars and amplifiers.
 My friend, Justin.
 I told you about him.
 Yeah, my friend from Omaha, plays the guitar. Anyway, he's coming to L.A. looking for some session work, so I told him he could just crash on my couch for a few weeks.
 He's not some guy. He's my friend.
 Well, he's definitely not gay.
 Okay, we went out a little bit, a long time ago, but we were never like going out.
 Do you have a problem with Justin staying with me?
 You know what? Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.
 How is that not talking to me like I'm an idiot? It's my friend, it's my couch, and it's my freaking life!
 Hey, if I want to invite the entire line up of Lollapalooza to sleep in my apartment, I will, and it's none of your business!
 Oh, now I'm a child? Well, at least I'm not an idiot anymore!
 Oh, you are such a ...  What the hell is he doing?
 Sheldon, just stop, look, the fight is over. Oh, and FYI, you never even heard of The Black Eyed Peas until you met me!
 Hey.
 Not really, no.
 Are you ready to apologize?
 E-e-e-e-eh! Wrong answer, but thank you for playing.
 Oh, there it is again! You think I'm stupid!
 Oh, yeah? well, there's a difference between being a jerk and being an ass!
 Oh, thank you very much. Come back soon. With the other half of my tip. Hey, Sheldon, what are you doing here?
 Is Leonard coming?
 Well, that's not gonna happen.
 Which is?
 I'm busy.
 Fine. What do you want?
 Yes.
 No, no, Sheldon, they just make a half-sandwich.
 Okay, fine, it's soup and a small sandwich. Is that what you want?
 Great.
 Don't you usually get lemonade?
 Do you want lemonade?
 Anything else?
 I am not going to apologize. I've done nothing wrong. He is completely overreacting.
 Well, I'm sorry, Sheldon, but this really isn't about you.
 Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there. Look, Sheldon, I have to go.
 Leonard is wrong.
 I'm coming. Goodbye, Sheldon. What do you mean, transgressions I've committed?
 Like what? Yeah, yeah, I see you, you're making a little cheque sign in the air, I got it, just hold your horses. What does Leonard complain about?
 My singing?
 Okay, if Leonard has so many problems with me, why hasn't he just said so?
 Oh, really? Well, then, do me a favour and tell Leonard that he can drop dead!
 Leonard!
 I hear you don't like my stuffed animals, my driving or my punctuality.
 It doesn't matter why he told me. It's true, isn't it?
 That isn't even your problem, the problem is you don't trust me!
 Oh, your yelling must have freaked him out again.
 No, I'm going to go find your damn roommate before he hurts himself trying to cross the street or something!
 Oh, now I need your permission for that, too?!
 Really? Why not? You're so smart, and I'm so dumb!
 Sheldon!
 Hey, why don't you just let me find him while you sit there hitting your imaginary brake?
 What stop sign?
 Yeah?
 What do you mean?
 Oh, yeah, kind of. It's, it's no big thing.
 All right, what's going on?
 Come on, Sheldon, let's go home. Look, we're done fighting.
 Okay, there's going to no more shouting and no skeet-shooting.
 Oh, my God, would you let this go?!
 Leonard, will you just let me handle this, please? Look, let's just ...  Sheldon, please, try and understand. Look, Leonard and I are in a relationship, and occasionally, we're going to fight. But no matter what happens between us, we will always love you. Right, Leonard?
 You know, how about we buy you this robot, and then we all go home?
 Okay, you can have that one.
 Buy him the robot, Leonard.
 Yes, you can.
 He's a musician. He'll sleep in his own vomit, if he has to.
 Sheldon help!
 Come in! Hurry!
 I'm back here.
 Oh, for god's sakes, I'm in the bathroom!
 Get in here! Hurry! Don't you dare knock.
 I slipped in the shower, and I think I dislocated my shoulder.
 What?
 I know. I slipped.
 Yeah, okay, whatever. Will you just turn the water off and help me up?
 What?
 Uh-huh.
 Oh, my god. I got to go to the emergency room.
 Okay, can you drive me?
 Well, I can't drive!
 Ow.
 No, no, no, I can't wait that long, you got to help me, please.
 No one's saying that. Let's go.
 I don't need panties, I just need shorts and a shirt.
 One was already in an accident.
 Clothes, Sheldon. I need clothes!
 Seriously? Those shorts with that top?
 No ...  No ...  Oh, that's cute.
 Okay, now, you got to help me put these on.
 But don't look.
 I don't want you to see me naked.
 Yeah, great.
 Ok, now you gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve.
 Is that my arm?
 Then, maybe you should let it go.
 You have your learner's permit, right?
 Good.
 All right, can we please go?
 It's right there.
 In a parking lot in Hollywood. Now, can we please go?
 Could you please drive a little faster?
 Nothing. The engine does that sometimes.
 No. The light has been on since I bought the car.
 It's not going to explode, just keep driving. Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock.
 Oh, god, I'm gonna lose the arm.
 What?
 It's not soup, it's courage.
 How did you see it? You said you wouldn't look.
 I dislocated my shoulder.
 You ready know that.
 No.
 No.
 Getting one.
 No.
 Change migraine to yes.
 Oh, next question.
 Oh, my god, what the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder?
 Ass.
 Hey, Sheldon, Sheldon, look, I am scared and in a lot of pain. Could you please just take a break from being you for just a minute and try being, I don't know, comforting?
 Thanks. That's much better.
 Wait. You have to help me get into bed. Sheldon has to get me into bed. Bet you never thought I'd say that.
 You know, people think you're this weird robot man who's so annoying all the time, and you totally are, but then it's like that movie Wall-E at the end. You're so full of love, and you can save a plant and get fat people out of the floaty chairs.
 Sing "Soft Kitty" to me.
 Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.
 Wait, wait. Let's sing it as a round. I'll start. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur ...  See that's where you come in. I'll start over. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur ...  I've got all night, Sheldon. Soft kitty, warm kitty ...  little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.
 Why are you back from your date so early?
 What exactly does that mean?
 Hi, guys.
 Yo, Raj, talk to me. I'm sorry, just screwing with you. Hey,  Howard, why haven't you called Bernardette?
 Yeah, she said she hasn't heard from you in a week. I thought you liked her?
 She agreed to go out with you for free. What more do you need?
 Different how?
 Are you high?
  Howard, you're going to throw away a great girl like Bernardette because you're holding out for some ridiculous fantasy?
 Hey, I did not settle for Leonard. I mean, obviously, he isn't the kind of guy I usually go out with, you know, physically.
 My point is, I do not judge a book by its cover. I am interested in the person underneath.
 All right, you know what, I will tell you why it's wrong ... 
 What?
 Oh, gee, you're too late. Scarlett Johansson and Wonder Woman were just in here trolling around for neurotic, little weasels.
 Yes, but I don't think she wants to see you.
 Come on,  Howard. You hurt her feelings by not calling her all week. Plus, I've kind of been talkig some smack about ya.
 Wow.
 Hey, here's your tip from table seven.
 Mm-hmm.
 You want me to throw him out?
 Are you sure? He's small. I bet I can get a nice, tight spiral on him.
 Oh, I am so sorry.
 Hey, Leonard, check this out. 
 You want me to put it back?
 Oh, come on, it's fine. We'll just put it all on the table, you know, family style.
 NO!
 Oh, yeah, you can't sit there.
 Oh no, no, you see, in the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he's warm, yet not so close that he sweats. In the summer, it's directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that isn't direct, so he can still talk to everybody, yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted.
 Oh, thanks. They are cute, aren't they?
 Shoes for Less.
 Oh, great selection, great prices.
 Womenfolk?
 Just eat your dinner.
 Yeah, well, I don't think it's very funny.
  Howard, never let her go.
 Hey, Sheldon, can I talk to you for a second?
 It's not about shoes.
 Um, actually, can we do it in private?
 Thanks, Raj. Okay, so here's the thing, I was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?
 Yeah, okay, cool. I don't need the PBS special, I just want to know enough so I can talk to Leonard about his job. You know, like Bernardette does.
 Beause I want to surprise him.
 Come on, Sheldon, this is important to me.
 You're sitting here playing video games all day.
 Sure. I did the one with the frogs.
 Yeah, actually, it was pretty cool. A lot of the girls threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer.
 Oh, come on! A smart guy like you, it'll be a challenge. You can make it like an experiment.
 Great! It's a little insulting, but great. I'll be KoKo.
 Hey, Sheldon.
 Ready to get started?
 Um, I don't have one.
 I have to take notes?
 There's gonna be a test?
 Thank you.
 Ancient Greece?
 Um, does this have anything to do with Leonard's work?
 Twenty six hundred years?
 I have to go to the bathroom.
 Not for twenty six hundred years.
 Uh, we know that ...  Newton was a really smart cookie. Oh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?
 Sorry.
 I don't know.
 Hey! You don't have to be so mean!
 No, you just suck at teaching.
 Oh, God, Sheldon, look I'm trying to understand, but you're going too fast. Can you just back up a little bit?
 Not that far back!
 I don't know. Where were we looking up at the night sky?
 Damn it!
 Squared?
 Aristotle?
 Five?
 Then I don't know.
 Because I'm stupid!
 Okay, look, can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?
 Really? That's it? Well, that doesn't sound so complicated.
 Okay, I just have one question. What exactly are sub-atomic particles?
 Thank you.
 Oh, balls.
 Actually, that's not true, Leonard. In fact, recently I've been thinking that given the parameters of your experiment, the transport of electrons through the aperture the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different than the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands. Their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum-interference effect. That's it. That's all I know. Oh, wait! Fig Newtons were named after a town in Massachusetts, not the scientist.
 Oh, I always tear up when the Grinch's heart grows three sizes.
 You really didn't like it, Sheldon?
 I just love decorating the Christmas tree. It makes me feel like a little girl again.
 Really? Why not?
 Oh, sounds festive. Did you at least give presents?
 Sheldon, what about you? Did you have a Christmas tree?
 So I take it you don't want to help us trim the tree.
 What is it?
 Oh, sure, sure, yeah. Very Christmassy.
 No, it's fine. Look, Sir Isaac can go right next to this little candy cane.
 What? Your ...  your mother's coming? When?
 When were you going to tell me?
 Why were you keeping this a secret?
 Why wouldn't she approve of me? I'm adorable.
 Hey, it's a big menu. There's two pages just for desserts.
 Okay, you know what? It's lame when I say it, it's just ridiculous when you pile on.
 So what did she say when you told her we were going out?
 You didn't tell her we were going out, did you?
 Why not?
 Hi. Sorry I'm late.
 Well, he sent me a football and a catcher's mitt for Christmas, so I'm going to say no.
 No, it sounded like a compliment.
 Nothing. Not a damn thing.
 Oh, it's not a problem.
 No, you do not.
 Yeah, I gotta put a sticker over that. So, uh, you must be devastated about your divorce.
 Come on, I mean, you're not upset that your marriage is over?
 Sure, sure.
 Eight years?
 Yikes. What's so funny?
 You know what? I could use a drink. Do you want to stop for a drink?
 I do, I'll teach you.
 Okay, now this time try drinking it all at once.
 I've been responsible for my own buzz since 2003. Another round for me and my homegirl.
 As long as you don't feel it running down your pants, you're fine.
 Well, we are known for our cheesecake. Hit us again.
 Hey, Bev, guess what?
 I'm sleeping with your son.
 The one from whom I live across the hall from.
 Oh, Beverly, I can't talk to my boyfriend's mother about his penis.
 Actually, I've only had the cheesecake. One more time. You know, Leonard did not want to tell you we were dating.
 Well, let's go find out who.
 Leonard?
 Get out here! Your mommy wants to talk to you!
 You're in trouble.
 Yeah, not bad, not bad.
 Oh, thank you.
 What the hell happened to lovely and charming?
 That's the Del Taco.
 I blame Penny, too. Bad Penny.
 Agreed.
 Oh, thank you, Beverly.
 Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la la-la.
 That you'd be willing to die a horrible death on the off-chance you'd get to second base?
 Well, the last big thing I did was this production of Diary of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. But I think things might be turning around pretty soon.
 Well, promise you won't make fun of me.
 Okay. Well, I went to this psychic who told me that if I cut my hair, I'm going to get a national commercial.
 She's not one of those phonies, okay. She wrote a book and has her own Web site.
 Why are you being such a jerk?
 Ha-ha, bite me.
 Oh, we don't need to talk about that anymore. Leonard covered it pretty well in the car.
 Right, and if you can't understand it, it's not a fact.
 Oh, got it. Thank you for educating me.
 Amazing. Would you like to try some?
 Well, the fact is, you can't.
 Maybe some of us should stop talking altogether.
 Wow, that's all you got after you were the most obnoxious person on a double date that included  Howard Wolowitz?
 Thank you. Would you be willing to go to my psychic and see what it's all about?
 I would not.
 Really?
 You saying I don't have an open mind?
 You know, I believe in ghosts, too.
 And astrology.
 Oh, no, no, no, crystals don't work.
 Oh, voodoo's real. You don't want to mess with voodoo.
 I can't believe it. If I hadn't been working the dinner shift, I would've run right into the robbers.
 I'm not scared. I would've gone all Nebraska on their asses.
 It won't happen again, what's up?
 Good night. That was weird, even for him.
 Who is it?
 Yes?
 Yeah.
 Sheldon, do you want to sleep here tonight?
 Um ...  three little kittens? Three little pigs? God, I don't know. Star Wars?
 Look, Sheldon, sweetie, I know you're feeling insecure, but we've really got to go to sleep.
 Wait, wait, what's 0400?
 That's, like, in 45 minutes.
 Raj, your car is blocking me ...  What the hell?
 Oh, my ... 
 He doesn't need to know what we were doing, Leonard.
 No, thanks.
 Ugh, what can you do? Here. 
 Sheldon, are you okay?
 Come on, Sheldon, you can't move. Don't you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns?
 Is he quitting his job at the university?
 Born and raised. 
 Sheldon, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm going to miss you.
 Sheldon, that's so ...  
 Whatcha doing?
 Interesting. I usually just have coffee. You've been up all night?
 Yes.
 And you're stuck?
 Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can't help you till I've had my coffee.
 What is he doing now?
 Not recently.
 For me, the worst part was when people saw us leave with them.
 Shh.
 Oh, poor baby.
 Oh, what a gentleman. Hey, Sheldon.
 Oh, damn.
 Do I look okay?
 Oh, you've been falling all night. You're used to it.
 Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?
 Leonard, you're ...  you're giggling in your sleep.
 Well, it creeps me out.
 Just answer the phone.
 What happened?
 Okay. Have fun.
 Sheldon, what do you want?
 Hey, you know what, Leonard, I know I said I could handle your roommate, but I was wrong. We're going to have to break up.
 Oh.
 Leonard doesn't snore.
 Okay, I'll get those drinks started for you.
 Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?
 No, wait, wait, no, wait. Wh.. what are you doing here?
 You just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that?
 Sheldon, this is ridiculous.
 Sheldon, wait, this isn't even what I do. I'm a waitress, not a busboy.
 Hey, guys, sorry you had to wait, but we are swamped. What's this?
 Sheldon doesn't work here.
 Sheldon, where are you going? Aren't you going to clean this up?
 Okay, what's the big surprise?
 Oh. Wow. Okay. Let's see. We've got, uh, milk chocolate, Swiss cheese, fondue. My lactose-intolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this, then I'm going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon?
 Okay, I'm starting to think Swiss is key here.
 We're going to Disneyland and ride the Matterhorn?
 We're going to Disney World and ride the Matterhorn?
 Okay, sweetie, this started out fun, but I'm over it.
 We're going skiing in Switzerland?!
 Oh, my God, Leonard! That's incredible!
 My Rabe-what-ly?
 You actually put that in an agreement?
 Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?
 Okay, I know I shouldn't ask, but what is ... ?
 It's not over, is it?
 Hello.
 Well, I always figured it was to study us, discover our weaknesses, and report back to your alien overlords.
 Better acoustics for your throat singing?
 Oh, for God's sakes.
 I'm sorry. Is this supposed to be buttering me up?
 Okay, show's over.
 Sheldon, this is Leonard's decision. He invited me to Switzerland, and I intend to go.
 I'll talk to Leonard.
 Yes. If it means that much to you, you should go.
 You're welcome.
 I think we're there.
 I know! I went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion.
 Think it through, Leonard.
 Oh!
 No, no, it's probably just allergies.
 Do any of them work?
 Did that sound okay to you? Do not come in here!
 I'm having a tea party. What do you think's going on? I think I might have the flu. Or the plague.
 Yep. Because I'm gonna be dead.
 Here's your soup.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Why don't I pour it in your lap, and you can tell me.
 Yeah, well, I'm sick, too.
 I don't know what to tell you, Sheldon.
 Happy Valentine's Day.
 Hi!
 Um, can you give me a hint?
 Um, Stanley, Stanley, Stanley Tucci?
 Oh, oh, Stan Lee! Cool!
 Of course I do. You're an important part of my life and I pay attention to the things you are interested in.
 Um, he was on Star Trek.
 Star Wars?
 Um, uh, Stan Lee, oh, he was in those goofy kung fu movies you love so much?
 Oh. So, is this Bruce Lee's nerdy brother, Stan?
 I'm sorry. You sent more than one letter about that?
 No, it isn't.
 No, it isn't.
 Mmm, no, it isn't.
 Okay, look, they sent me the ticket. I told them I wasn't driving and they were all, if it wasn't you, who was it?
 No! It wasn't a betrayal. It was more of a can't afford any more points on my license. I already have to buy my insurance from this place in the Cayman Islands.
 Yes, yes, look, and now you have a photo to remember that heroic day.
 Sheldon, I'm sorry. I'll be happy to reimburse you for the fine. You know, as soon as I get a part in a movie or my own TV series.
 Oh, balls.
Penny.
 All right, let's go.
 What is this?
 Do I have a choice?
 Darn tootin', I do, if the court will excuse my homespun, corn-fed Nebraskan turn of phrase.
 The reason that date is, like, so totally fixed in my memory is that I had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts I've ever seen in, like, ever.
 Why, you did, sir. You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and may I add, it is a privilege to know you.
 But it is a fact that it's a privilege to know you. Totally. A teardrop rolls down my cheek?
 But it is a fact that it's a privilege to know you. Totally.
 Sheldon's in jail.
 What do you think? For doing the same crap he always does, except to a judge. He has to stay in there until he apologizes.
 Oh, gee, thanks, Leonard. That didn't occur to me. If he doesn't apologize by 5 o'clock he is going to spend the night in jail.
 We're home.
 I'm going to write you a cheque for that. As long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it, like the others.
 Okay, I realize that ... 
 Okay, maybe you'll have another chance to have ... 
 Did he just somehow give me the finger?
 Hey, Stuart.
 What's going on?
 Ah. Cool. Got any fun plans?
 Oh, nice.
 Oh, okay. Well, I was hoping, um, you could do me a favour.
 Well, I'm kind of responsible for Sheldon missing Stan Lee, and I really want to make it up to him. So I was hoping you could give me his phone number so maybe I can arrange for them to meet.
 Hmm. Damn. All right. Thank you.
 Really? Great!
 Then why did you tell me you had it?
 I'm sorry, Stuart. Thanks anyway.
 Yeah?
 What kind of deal?
 You're extorting a date out of me?
 Can I bring Leonard?
 Deal.
 Yup.
 Okay, sweetie, I don't know if we're gonna have cookies, or he's just gonna say hi, or really what's gonna happen, so just let me talk, and we'll ... 
 Are you Stan Lee?
 Hi. I'm Penny. This is my friend, Sheldon.
 Right, right. Anyway, Sheldon here is a huge fan of yours, and he was supposed to meet you the other day at the comic book store, but he kind of ended up in jail.
 Oh, no, no, I said I'm inviting you to come with me to Stan Lee's house.
 I'm sorry. He doesn't really understand sarcasm.
 Nice to meet you.
 Oh, it's about time, I'm starving.
 Why not?
 Oh, no, you didn't trade the food for magic beans, did you?
 Yeah, sometimes I don't listen, sometimes I just watch your jaw go up and down.
 Who's Adam West?
 There a new girlfriend in there? Beause you might need one.
 That is so sad.
 Okay, I'm just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on eHarmony.
 Okay.
 Hey, guys. Enjoying your food that I actually brought you instead of promising food, but bringing you a box of random crap?
 What ring?
 Why?
 Okay, just to be clear, the first piece of jewellery my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie, and I don't even get to keep it?
 Sheldon tried to take the ring and I punched him.
 Whatcha doin'?
 No, no, no, no, no, no, you are my boyfriend. Nothing you do is silly to me.
 FYI, this is a bag from Victoria's Secret.
 Ugh, gotta go back to dating dumb guys from the gym.
 Sheldon, congratulations. Brought you cheesecake from work. You know, Because of your award, not because a busboy sneezed on it.
 Why not?
 That's no reason to back out. You know, I once got a pretty big honour in high school, and I was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd, but I went through with it, and you know what? The world looked pretty darn good sitting on a haystack in the back of a Ford F-150 as a member of the Corn Queen's court.
 I just love how you always skip over the part where no one asks.
 Oh, my God.
 Just sit.
 Yes, but you're not smarter than all of us put together.
 Okay, your problem is, you're trying to do this all by yourself.
 Did I see X-Men?
 Oh. I say a lot of things, sweetie. So, how about it, Sheldon?
 Okay. Well, I am going to take you shopping, get you a nice suit. Might give you more confidence.
 So, what do you say, Sheldon? Are we your X-Men?
 It'll give you confidence. You know, sometimes when I'm feeling all stressed out about something, I go out and buy a cute top or a fun skirt and I have a whole new outlook on life.
 Yeah, that's when I buy shoes. Now, let's see what we've got. Ooh! This is nice.
 Yeah, so?
 Fine. Why don't you pick out what you like.
 No, you're wrong.
 Where the hell d'you find that?
 It's ridiculous.
 Please just try this one on.
 What's the matter?
 Here, drink this. It'll relax you.
 Fine, faint.
 Here, see if this one works.
 Sure.
 Having a little trouble catching your breath there?
 Do or do not. There is no try.
 I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back.
 Oh. Oh. Thank you.
 Oh, yeah, no, I, I'm, I'm glad.
 Yeah. Yeah. No, no. Um. So, it's getting pretty late. We should probably go to sleep.
 Okay.
 Hmm.
 Okay, good night, sweetie.
 Hi.
 Oh, right, bowling.
 No, no, it's okay. I mean, let's face it, you guys would get creamed without me.
 It's always nice chatting with you, Sheldon.
 Thinly veiled contempt.
 Got it.
 Bite me!
 Yes. I love chilli cheese fries.
 Yeah, why?
 Do you really want to get into this right now?
 Okay, look, you just caught me by surprise last night. I didn't know what to say.
 I'm not sure.
 Okay, this isn't the place to have this conversation.
 Don't push it, Leonard.
 You are. You don't get to decide when I'm ready to say I love you!
 What?
 Ice cream?
 Um, Ach.
 Did Leonard send you over here?
 Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
 Again, I'm sorry.
 You're kidding.
 All right, Sheldon, what part of this is supposed to make me feel better?
 Oh, honey, I don't know. Things are a little weird with Leonard right now.
 No, no, that's okay. Just let me talk to him, and I'll get back to you.
 I don't know.
 You're not gonna leave me alone until I do it, are you?
 I think we should talk now.
 Really? So, you didn't get all snarky Because I said something nice to a bowl of chilli fries?
 Look, Leonard, you have to know how much I care about you. It's just that I've said the L word too soon before, and it didn't work out very well.
 I'm sorry. You know what I'm talking about, though.
 So, we're good?
 The Wesley Crushers?
 I don't get it.
 Still don't get it.
 Okay, I'm sorry, honey, but the Wesley Crushers sounds like a bunch of people who like Wesley Crusher.
 Thank you, Stuart. It's nice to know.
 Hey, thanks.
 Yeah.
 Mm-hmm.
 Yeah, that's right.
 Sheldon-don! Sheldon-don! Sheldon-don! Sheldon-don!
 The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball!
 Oh, yeah, me, too.
 Tell me about it.
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 Really?
 What are you talking about?
 No!
 Yeah, I got it.
 I know.
 Leonard, stop pressuring me.
 Yeah, you are! Just back off!
 I didn't mean shut up.
 No, this isn't fair to you, Leonard. I'm sorry.
 Oh, damn, they cancelled my Visa. Oh, yay, a new MasterCard!
 What?
 Okay. Are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?
 God, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?
 Okay, here's the protocol, you and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus.
 Really?
 Right.
 Everyone.
 Great.
 So, how you been?
 You're just coitusing with me, aren't you?
 Mmm. How's Leonard doing?
 I'll pretend I didn't hear it.
 Yep.
 Interesting. I'll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.
 Oh. Um, okay. Why don't you give me an hour and come over?
 I don't have hot dogs.
 So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?
 Well, good.
 He's been crying?
 Oh, God, I feel terrible.
 No. Why, do you?
 Why did you ask if I had one, too?
 All right. So, what's new in your life?
 Have you been running?
 I'm so glad you like it.
 Well, maybe that's Because Leonard can't cook.
 Whatever. Ooh, I'm gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge.
 Oh, um, I, I can come back.
 Yeah, I guess you're right.
 Nope.
 Oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me.
 Yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels.
 Oh, well, then you, you do it.
 Okay, you can take him for shoes.
 Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet.
 Oh, no, no, no, a bunch of us from work are going to Disneyland next Saturday and Sheldon wants to come.
 Well, he heard me making plans on the phone. Was I going to say no?
 We're going to Disneyland. He's going to eat junk food.
 Okay, whatever.
 All right, got it. Is there anything else?
 What's the problem with Goofy?
 We're home.
 How was I supposed to know that?
 I know, I know.
 No, you already threw up once. Go put on your PJs and brush your teeth.
 Just go.
 You're welcome, sweetie.
 Oh, um, I should probably get going.
 Yep, okay.
 Sheldon's churro on my shoes.
 He's such an angel when he's asleep.
 I think we can do it.
 No, be friends. You and me.
 Good. I'm glad.
 Good night, Leonard.
 Hey, Sheldon.
 What? What are you doing with, what?
 Sheldon, what are you doing with maxi pads?
 Oh. What?
 Wait, wait, hold on, back up. You're having a woman stay with you?
 Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm not flabbergasted. I'm puzzled. Yeah, let's go with puzzled.
 Female jibber jabber?
 Oh, they're not my friends.
 Oh, good, you're up. Look, my car won't start. I need a ride to work.
 No, Mr. smarty-pants. I ignored the fill gas tank light.
 Hello.
 Oh, Penny, this is Dr. Plimpton, a leading expert on quantum cosmology. Dr. Plimpton, Penny is a waitress who doesn't understand the role gasoline plays in the internal combustion engine.
 Nice to meet you, too. Are you enjoying your stay?
 Good.
 Hang on.
 We just broke up.
 Not as good as you apparently.
 You know what? It's, it's none of my business. If you want to sleep with Sheldon's doctor buddy right after we stopped seeing each other, go for it.
 I'm not recommending it. I'm saying it already happened.
 You know what? I'm just gonna take the bus to work.
 Oh, no, no, it's okay. You might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant.
 Oh, Leonard?
 I found these in the dryer. I'm assuming they belong to Sheldon.
 You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?
 Well, you don't owe me an explanation.
 No, you don't.
 Oh, I'm judging you nine ways to Sunday, but you don't owe me an explanation.
 I'm listening.
 Okay, Babydoll Pink, let's see if you can cover up the fact that I got my dad's feet.
 Who is it?
 Hang on.
 Uh, well, you can try, but the people across the hall are being very noisy.
 Apparently, the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat, then the other fella went bat-crap crazy.
 Well, not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him.
 Oh, I do not believe that.
 So Sheldon's last roommate tried to warn you off?
 Well, yeah, he'd been living with Sheldon.
 Okay, and after all that, you just moved in?
 Why on earth did you agree to all that?
 Well, I'm sorry, Leonard, it's very hard to feel sympathy for you.
 Oh, my God.
 A little bit. Okay. Let me get this straight. You move in with this guy, he makes you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement, then he walks into your bedroom while you're doing this Joyce Kim, and you still stay?
 Why not?
 What does that have to do with Joyce Kim?
 So, what, that's it? You've stayed with Sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison?
 Oh, yeah, I'm wondering about that. You said it was working when you moved in.
 Okay, what does all this have to do with the elevator?
 Okay, how do you know he said that? You left the room.
 Fine. Go ahead. (Flashback to  Howard's bedroom.)
 So, why was it his lucky day?
 What were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment?
 Are we ever going to get to the elevator?
 Okay, so, basically, you're the reason I have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day?
 Excuse me, I was in high school. Studying, keeping my nose clean, doing volunteer work for the community. (Flashback. Penny is in her bedroom, sitting on the bed with a guy, looking at a pregnancy tester.)
 Not pregnant. Yes!
 Oh, hi. What's going on?
 I'm sorry, what?
 Um ... 
 Uh, Leonard, this is Zack. Zack, Leonard.
 Yeah, maybe.
 Oh, but what about the party?
 Oh, right.
 Hey, guys, this is my friend Zack.
 Oh! That's very cool.
 Sheldon! Play nice.
 Okay, guys, thank you, it's been fun.
 No, just keep walking.
 Damn you, you rat bastard.
 Zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him!
 Because in the olden days, I never would've known he was so stupid.
 Yes, he was! He thought you were gonna blow up the moon!
 He spent the entire night bragging about how he invented the word appe-teasers.
 You have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots. Now, come with me.
 We're gonna have sex.
 Put on your noise-cancelling headphones, Because it's gonna get loud.
 What, do you have eyes in the back of your head?
 Oh, thanks, I'm not hungry.
 Yeah, sorry about that.
 Oh, God.
 Oh, hi. Um, I gotta run. Early shift.
 Yeah, it must have been. I just threw up in my closet.
 Oh, yeah, tonight's not great for me.
 Leonard, last night was a mistake.
 Look, I'm sorry. I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack. Can we just forget it ever happened?
 Oh, God!
 Look, I said I'm sorry. Can't u please let it go?
 Oh. Hey, Leonard.
 Are you drunk?
 Are you out of your mind?!
