 Alright.
 I don’t think that’s going to happen, Sheldon.
 So how’s work?
 Yeah, we all are.
 His girlfriend.
 Four months.
 Wait a minute– a child? You never see this girl. You just e-mail and text and Twitter. Now you’re considering having a baby?
 Still digging the Shamy?
 Yeah?
 What?
 Hold that thought. Hey, Howard, what’s going on? What? Hold on, Howard, Howard, slow down. The robot hand is stuck on your what? You’re not going to believe this.
 I’d suggest a lubricant, but I have a feeling you fell on some of that as well.
 Okay, let’s see.
 Well, then let’s un-pause it.
 You do what you want, I’m not touching another man’s honey tree.
 How about an acetylene torch?
 Well, then what do you want us to do?
 You have any ideas, Raj?
 Okay, come on. Almost there.
 Excuse me, could you help us out?
 Uh, it’s what controls the arm.
 Hey, Howard, what’s up?
 Yeah, yeah, great. Howard, uh, slow down. What do you mean it happened again?
 Whatcha doin’ there? Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?
 Yes.
 Yes.
 A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?
 Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. What’s KBB?
 How’s that?
 I don’t think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.
 You can always get a badger and find out.
 That long, huh?
 What’s there?
 So, you’re upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?
 Tough break. You want eggs?
 What’s a dogapus?
 Is somebody working on that?
 Wait a minute. You hate dogs.
 It came to $28.17. Let’s say six bucks apiece.
 Thank you.
 Never mind. I got it.
 It’s no big deal.
 Hmm? How much you got?
 How can you walk around with no money?
 It’s okay, you can owe me.
 Sheldon, six bucks.
 No, no, don’t ask.
 What the hell? What’s the matter?
 There’s no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena.
 When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?
 Have you had your appendix out?
 Let’s get you to the hospital.
 No.
 Funny how things work out, isn’t it?
 Good night.
 Here’s my chicken curry. Howard, your shrimp biryani.
 Palak paneer, that’s Penny.
 And for Rajesh Koothrappali, from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken McNuggets.
 Uh, 12 bucks.
 Sure.
 Well, okay, with the Indian food, the pizza, the Thai food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt and your rent, uh, a little over fourteen hundred dollars.
 Sheldon, are you gonna join us?
 Greetings, whatever the hell you are.
 This is ridiculous. I’m coming to talk to you.
 You’re in your bedroom.
 I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.
 Sheldon, this is ridiculous.
 I am looking at you.
 You cannot exist as a virtual presence. Not here and certainly not at work. Oh, good God.
 At the hands of your roommate?
 That’s how I’m going to make it look.
 Fine, but don’t expect my help.
 No, it’s not.
 I’ll be damned.
 Uh-huh.
 Refresh my memory. Why didn’t I just put you in the trunk?
 Right.
 I don’t want to listen to music, Sheldon.
 Except in Knight Rider, the car isn’t a yammering sphincter.
 I was wrong, this is exactly like Knight Rider.
 No.
 That’s it. Bye-bye.
 Whoa!
 I almost died!
 I’m still going to go with you.
 What about it?
 Why? What’s the problem?
 No, I think a doorknob has you stymied.
 Why are you introducing yourself?
 I think it is.
 Penny, Steve Wozniak was one of the cofounders of Apple Computer. He and Steve Jobs started it…
 Of course you must.
 What the hell are you guys playing?
 All right. I like a good brainteaser. Give it a whirl.
 Uh, a BLT where the B stands for beaver? I don’t know.
 I can figure this out, let’s see. Um, well, beavers eat tree bark. The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon. So, I’ll say cinnamon.
 What?
 This is ridiculous. You’re just making stuff up.
 You bumped the table and you know it.
 I’m going to my room.
 Did you guys see the paper in The American Physics Journal on supersolids? It’s pretty interesting. This guy’s working from a hypothesis where…
 What?
 Sure.
 Okay.
 Ah, ah.
 So, this is nice. First time we’ve all gotten together to eat.
 Okay, that’s all I got. Howard, you’re up.
 Listen, can I talk to you about your girlfriend?
 Got it.
 Uh-huh. Anyway, I’m not sure she’s the best fit for our little, how should we call it, rebel alliance.
 Yeah, not my point.
 Okay, let me just get right to it. Amy is judgmental, sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious.
 So we already have you for all that.
 No, no, of course not. Just have your relationship someplace else.
 Suffered in silence?
 Really? Silence?
 I think we need to start entertaining the possibility that the Shamy could go on for years.
 I did.
 Well, he pointed out that he kinda, sorta had to put up with you.
 I didn’t agree with him.
 I tried, but he made a fairly well-reasoned argument.
 I assume by never again, you mean never again will you drink all of Penny’s beer, then run down to the gas station for a couple of 40s, a box of Slim Jims and the latest issue of Bombay Badonkadonks.
 Oh, no.
 John and Yoko.
 Hey.
Oooh!
 I’m sorry, I’m-I’m still trying to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell, so…
Uh-uh.
 I gotta tell you guys, I’m a little worried about Sheldon.
 No, I mean since the Shamy hit a reef.
 Uh, went splitsville.
 Turned to boom-boom.
 I think Sheldon really misses Amy.
 He got a cat to keep him company.
 He takes it everywhere, to bed, to the bathroom.
 Yeah.
 Hey. Oh, no.
 So you decided to get the whole Manhattan Project?
 Zazzles?
 Okay, we need to talk.
 Cats, Sheldon. You’re clearly upset about Amy being gone, and you’re trying to replace her with a bunch of cats.
 What?
 Okay, yeah, fine.
 Terrific. My-my point is you need to face up to what you’re feeling with this breakup.
 Okay, I got it, I got it, she’s not your girlfriend. Now listen to me. I know about loneliness. I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff. When I broke up with Penny, I got back into my cello, I built a bunch of model rockets, I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell.
 She didn’t dump me. It was mutual!
 Okay, fine. Live with cats. Be like my Aunt Nancy. She had dozens of them. And do you know what happened after she died? They ate her.
 Hi, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming.
 He’s in his bedroom.
 No, she’s real.
 No, no, it’s not like that. It’s, uh, I don’t know what it’s like. But there is something I should prepare you for.
 Hold on to that thought.
 Surprise.
 25 cats!
 I saw what you did there.
 No, no, no, I can do it.
 Yeah, it’s like if Alien and Predator decided to go partners in a Jamba Juice.
 Hang on a second. I could have the fruit platter.
 Does it have melon on it?
 No, I can’t eat melon.
 When was the last time you saw her?
 Hey.
 You know, you never told me what happened between you and Bernadette.
 Yeah, I guessed that.
 That covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy. Oh, my God. You ran over a hobo.
 All right, fine. So you want to get back together with her, but you’re too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did.
 Okay. Well, how about this? Kidnap Bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn’t know it’s you.
 Why can’t he have a desk, Sheldon?
 Sheldon.
 Why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?
 So anyway, Howard asked Penny to talk to Bernadette, and she did, and Bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee.
 Yeah?
 I don’t know. Sometimes your movements are so lifelike, I forget you’re not a real boy.
 Oh, congratulations. Have you broken it to the troll yet?
 No. Steve Patterson told me.
 Yeah.
 He’s Glissinda the troll.
 So anyway, that’s great news about you and Bernadette.
 Ah. Well, I guess for you guys that’s like regular golf.
 Yeah, and don’t you forget it.
 Oh, God, what’s that smell? Oh-ho-hoo!
 What are you doing in there?
 Didn’t you say you’re making hydrogen sulphide gas?
 Isn’t that flammable?
 All I’m saying is, if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent Hulk movie, they could probably just make an actual Hulk.
 Thank you.
 So what’s going on with you two?
 Right, right. So you’re still just texting and emailing? You don’t feel any need to hang out with her, you know, be in the same room?
 Got it.
 No, no. Maybe a little.
 Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?
 Oh, right. That.
 I’m not jealous.
 Probably. What’s your point?
 Hmm, recently? Not much.
 Um, shut up.
 That sounds lovely.
 Sheldon, I’m just not dating someone right now. I don’t need to go to a senior centre.
 Fine. If I don’t meet someone soon, you can put me in a home.
 Hey, guys.
 You realize he’s just rubbing our noses in the fact that he has a girlfriend, and we don’t.
 You have a girlfriend? How could you have a girlfriend? You can’t even speak to women.
 What?
 Great. You have a girlfriend, Howard’s got a girlfriend, Sheldon’s got a girl…
 …who’s a friend.
 What about you, Stuart? You have a girlfriend yet?
 Oh. Well, good for you.
 Why don’t you just break up with her?
 Why not?
 Because I don’t need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends. I’m perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own.
 You’re saying I couldn’t get laid in a women’s prison with a handful of pardons.
 No.
 No.
 I don’t know. Maybe.
 Thank you.
 What the hell? How long has she been here?
 That was two hours ago.
 No.
 No, I’m not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar.
 Right.
 Keep going. I’m listening.
 Yeah, what?
 Yeah. So?
 Well, you know how you’re always saying that Amy is a girl who’s your friend, and not your girlfriend?
 You can’t say that anymore.
 Look, she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level.
 Me? Well, how am I supposed to fix it?
 That is insane.
 Okay, good luck.
 Well, have you considered telling her how you feel?
 All right, well, let me see if I can explain your situation using physics. What would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?
 There you go.
 The volcano thing? No.
 No, it’s just something I threw on.
 Yeah. Turns out, they guard the iPods, but they don’t guard the shirts.
 It was going well. I was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in Safe Mode. The manager got suspicious, and, well, long story short, they really do have a little jail in the mall.
 I want to invoke the girlfriend pact, Howard.
 No, I just, I want what you have. You know, I want a woman in my life.
 To be clear, I meant like Bernadette, not your mother.
 Well, I’m off to meet Bernadette’s friend. How do I look?
 What are you working on?
 Ah, you’re going off the grid.
 The old Unabomber approach. Kudos.
 What if she just comes over?
 You changed the address on the building? What about mail?
 Who is it?
 She’s been here before.
 What do you want to do?
 Okay, where are you?
 Hi, Amy. Sheldon’s not here.
 Thanks again for doing this, Bernadette.
 Hi.
 Uh…
 Yeah. So, Bernadette tells me she knows you from self-defence classes?
 Wow. Wouldn’t think there’d be that many.
 Whoa!
 Should be, it’s thirty dollars a pound.
 Yep, it is.
 Whoa!
 Or maybe she’ll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off. There are still 93 ways she hasn’t tried yet. Look, Howard, I appreciate the effort, but this is, like, the worst date of my life.
 I guess the difference is, I have some self-respect.
 It’s relatively new. I just know that I’m not gonna spend time with someone I don’t like simply to have a girlfriend. I’m okay on my own.
 Look, uh, Joy, it was nice to meet you, but…
 You’re asking me out?
 I look forward to it.
 Problem?
 The hope has been that you’d eventually bend to public opinion. So, Priya, what brings you back to LA?
 And your poll numbers just keep dropping.
 I’m going too, I’ll show you where it is.
 Yeah. It’s good to see you too. Here you go.
 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. Okay.
 Hmm, Priya’s not back yet? Well, I guess that’s not unusual, women, men, the whole sitting, standing deal, so, what are we talking about?
 Did you make it clear that it’s two different train cars turned into hot dog stands?
 I guess he just hates fun.
 So, uh, Priya, what are your plans while you’re here.
 It’s getting pretty late, how come you’re still up?
 That’s pretty cool.
 You’ve really got to get out more.
 Yeah, well, Sheldon’s still up.
 Yeah, he does but he got caught up in a computer game and…
 If the past is any indication, no.
 Drop axe.
 Give me a minute. Sheldon,
 Sheldon, you need to work in the morning.
 Well then, bed mister.
 Really? You’re going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar? You know what happens when you yawn in public.
 You don’t want that, do you?
 Oh, uh, building manager. They have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two.
 No, no, it doesn’t matter, we’ll be at work.
 Bifurcated uvula, Sheldon!
 We’re going to have to be very quiet.
 No, no, no, no, no. You just need, you just need, you just need to map it out. Come on, I’ll help you. So, uh, you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times?
 You’re right, you’re lost, good luck.
 Huh! Sorry!
 I don’t know. When I’m in bed with a girl, it’s just, it’s my go to response.
 Oh, right, sure. I wish you could stay in LA a while longer.
 You know, I was thinking, there are some great research facilities in India.
 Well, I’m just saying, I don’t have any real ties here, so if I were to move to New Delhi we could, you know, go out.
 Well, yes, but, things have changed, you know, you’re older, I’m older. Look, no more superhero bedsheets.
 It doesn’t?
 I’m not that white. My great-great grandmother was half Cherokee. I know that’s not the right kind of Indian but it is something.
 What?
 Oh, uh, yeah, I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman.
 Air freshener.
 Uh, rash, that’s a bad rash.
 Uh, yeah, yeah, that sounds great.
 Okay, he’s in the bathroom, let’s go.
 Uh, cream.
 Without.
 Fine. With.
 Use your best judgement.
 Sounds great.
 Right, right, alright.
 Making pretty good time, huh?
 No.
 Please don’t tell anyone I spent the night with Raj’s sister.
 No-one’s going to ask if I spent the night with Raj’s sister.
 Like what?
 Priya and I are both adults. We didn’t betray Raj.
 What are you talking about?
 Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard.
 Alright, and Raj.
 You?
 Okay fine, I’m, I’m a horrible human being, I’m the Darth Vader of Pasadena.
 My point is, Priya’s gone. And it would be much better if no-one else found out about this.
 Yes.
 You can if you try. Think about it this way, if I were Batman and you were Alfred, you’d keep that secret. Right?
 Because, well, Batman has the secret.
 Like what?
 What.
 Kind of busy here, Sheldon.
 What do you want.
 What alibi?
 Oh, I’m so sure I’m going to regret this, but, who was I with?
 Oh, God.
 Leonard, call me if you’re interested in coitus. Sincerely, Maggie McGeary.
 Where did you get that?
 An orang-u-tan?
 Sheldon, I don’t need an alibi. Nobody’s going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip. Thank you. Now don’t worry, everything is going to be fine. (Sheldon writes “I doubt it” on Leonard’s whiteboard.
 Hey.
 C’mon Raj, how am I supposed to know who she’s attracted to. Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to. In the future.
 I didn’t see it.
 Uh, I was out.
 Yeah, I, uh, went for a drink.
 To, uh, Lucky Baldwin’s.
 Yes.
 As a matter of fact I.. I… I can’t… I can’t… I can’t do it.
 Look, I’m sorry Raj, but the truth is I was with Priya last night.
 Yeah.
 Look, I admit it, I may have crossed a line here, but come on, Raj, your sister is a grown woman. To her, I’m a forbidden piece of white chocolate.
 No, no, no, would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it.
 Very hard.
 Really?
 Was it out of respect that you didn’t tell Raj about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?
 You put moths in my food?
 Well, uh, I can’t believe you used Sheldon’s toothbrush.
 Okay, I, I, I think it’s safe to say that we’ve all done some things we’re not particularly proud of. But come on, we’re friends. Friends overlook each other’s minor lapses. For the record, Howard, I’m sorry that I broke our pact.
 Hey, you got Snoopy out. Can I have a snowcone?
 These are pretty god, what flavour is this?
 Papaya?
 Guava?
 I give up.
 No, seriously, I think I’ve finally figured out my problem with women.
 What does that have to do with me and women?
 My problem is, I don’t project confidence. So I decided that the next time I meet a woman I think is attractive, rather than holding back and being cautious, I’m going to assume the mantle of self-assurance.
 Hi. I’m Leonard. And you are beautiful. You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I’m going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget.
 Congratulations Howard.
 Why not?
 Don’t be ridiculous, Raj. You’re here legally.
 Fine, Sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents.
 So, when Howard said the FBI would be contacting me, I was expecting Mulder. Glad to see I got Scully.
 Mulder and Scully. X-Files. The truth is out there. Never mind. Uh, so, what would you like to know?
 Yes. Of course, we’re in different departments. He’s an engineer and I’m an experimental physicist. You know, one of those guys who examines the building blocks of creation and says, Hello, maker of the universe, I see what you did there. Good one.
 Good. It’s a good relationship. Of course, most of my relationships are good. Probably because I exude confidence. People are drawn to that, you know? Confidence, not exuding.
 You are beautiful, you know that? You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I’m going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget.
 Really?
 Is that, oh, my, I didn’t see the ring with my glasses off, so, look at that, I’m starting to exude.
 Want to get that?
 Could you get that?
 Would you please get that?
 What happened?
 And I may have hit on her a little bit.
 I feel awful.
 To tell you the truth, I thought if anyone was going to screw things up for Howard, it’d be Sheldon.
 What are you doing up?
 Really? Maybe sleep has met you before.
 I’m sorry. Why can’t you sleep?
 Did something happen today that’s bothering you?
 What?
 Because you feel guilty?
 Actually, you don’t have insomnia. You’re sleeping now.
 You’re having a guilt-ridden dream.
 How about that Gorn sitting on the couch?
 Hey.
 94 seconds.
 I can’t believe you’ve never seen Raiders of the Lost Ark.
 When she comes out with Eat, Pray, Run Away From A Giant Boulder, I’ll read it.
 Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary track?
 Exactly. They say it finally solves the submarine controversy.
 Bet if I could make you understand why this is such a cool thing, we’d still be together.
 Relax, it’s five o’clock. The movie doesn’t start till midnight.
 Don’t worry, Sheldon. We’ll be fine.
 Oh. Well, he waited in line for 14 hours, while you napped in a lawn chair, he got in a fight with a Klingon when he stepped out of line to pee and you wouldn’t wake up to vouch for him, and worst of all, he saw Star Trek
 Excellent.
 Thank you, Amy.
 Guys, that’s really starting to get old.
 Who’s there?
 Hysterical!
 Who‘s there?
 Hugh who?
 So I guess it’s a good thing we stopped for dinner.
 Oh, I hope they let us in soon. I’m tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom. The guy makes me buy a Gatorade every time. It’s a vicious circle.
 What’s a stadium pal?
 Nice going, Raj, just got him down for his nap.
 It’s fine, it’s fine. Go back to sleep.
 Howard, you talk to him. Howard? You’re peeing, aren’t you?
 Calm down, Sheldon.
 Had to wake him up from his nap, didn’t you?
 Why do you read his Twitter feed? You know it’s only going to upset you.
 We really want to see this. Is there anything you can do?
 Short Round?
 Yeah, I know who it is, but why is it me?
 Sheldon? Sheldon?
 What is that?
 Sheldon, this is crazy.
 Listen to me. You are over-tired. You’re not thinking right. Put the movie back before we get into trouble.
 Yeah.
 He’s not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after The Thing?
 I’ll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food.
 Oh, um, is Penny here?
 Yeah.
 Okay, I think a bit of context here might help.
 Oh, good. Context.
 That was odd.
 You’ll never guess what just happened.
 No.
 Penny kissed me.
 A big kiss. On the mouth.
 She introduced me to her father, kissed me and then shut the door in my face.
 You think?
 Penny kissing me is not insane. She used to kiss me all the time.
 I’m just saying, it felt like it may have meant something.
 Why do I bother talking to you people?
 Yeah, sure.
 What, uh, the kissing and everything? Nah, women do that to me all the time.
 What? Why?
 What kind of guys did you used to go out with?
 Really? How, how’d we manage that?
 Well, did you apologize? Did you have to woo me?
 Yeah, no, I don’t think so.
 I’m just saying, if we fake got back together, that’s totally not how it fake happened.
 Hold on, you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of sham play acting and kissing? Cause I’m good with that.
 See? He doesn’t mind.
 Uh, I do, I have to work. But I’m gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father, ’cause, you know, just the kind of boyfriend I am.
 Come here, you.
 Thanks for the steak, Wyatt.
 A lot of people are doing that.
 Thanks, Wyatt. I’m a keeper.
 Maybe I could go in a little late.
 Don’t I know it.
 Good night, Wyatt. Oh, good night, honey.
 I love you.
 Coming. Hey, lovebug.
 Mm, dreamily doodling Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter in a notebook?
 You got to admit, I am, I’m delightful.
 It’s not difficult for me. I’m having fun.
 What do you want me to do? You started this. Do you want to go over and tell him we’re broken up?
 Well, then, what do you want?
 Don’t you think that’s something you should have figured out before you stomped over here?
 I have a list. FYI, overuse of the phrase, oh, my god, is number 12.
 Ba-ba-ba-ba. Are you sure you want to include him in this?
 Fines?
 Oh, b-be careful. Give him some line. Okay, now reel him in.
 Yeah. They do that when you set it on easy.
 Hey, baby. I love you! Mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh.
 Oh, hey. There’s been something I’ve been meaning to tell you.
 Just for the record, I did not want to be a part of this.
 No hurry.
 What?
 Gee, I don’t know if it’s in the cards, sir.
 I’ll give it a shot.
 Excuse me?
 Oh, the reverse psychology thing. I see. That’s very clever.
 I’ll friend you on Facebook.
 Yeah, well, not necessary. We broke up again.
 Oh, how’d it go last night?
 Really? You waited months for time with that telescope. What happened?
 Hey.
 You get to play with Raj’s big telescope last night?
 It is. You just kind of put a damper on things when you said, the next person I see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death.
 Great.
 No.
 We get it. 73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.
 Remember when you were wondering why the girls didn’t want to eat with us tonight?
 No. What happened?
 12 years after high school, and I’m still at the nerd table.
 Really? This is going to decide who’s the hero and who’s the sidekick?
 Every idea is better than this idea.
 Suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night. None come to mind.
 Fellas. It’s been 30 minutes. Nobody’s touched each other.
 Lesser Warlord of Ka’a.
 Infinite Sheldon?
 Do you understand why people don’t want to play with you?
 Hey.
 Hey.
 Oh, thanks.
 That’s an atom.
 So, you and Zack again, huh?
 They might be smarter than some people.
 A dolphin might.
 You think Penny’s right? Were we bullying Zack?
 That happened to you?
 I don’t know, I think we might owe the guy an apology.
 Why me?
 What would I even say?
 I got a better idea. We’re all responsible. I say we all go. Come on, who’s with me? Free comic books to anyone who comes with me. I might get punched. You really want to miss that?
 Yeah, we came to talk to Zack. Hey, Zack.
 Listen, uh, the stuff we were saying before, we were just kidding around.
 Come on, that’s what we do. We give each other a hard time. Hey, Sheldon, you look like a praying mantis.
 See?
 Uh, we’re on our way to the comic book store.
 Don’t.
 Uh, no. Oh, this is Zack. He’s a friend of ours. Zack, this is Stuart. He owns the store.
 Hey, I got new boots this year. Guaranteed to add three inches.
 Zack?
 You can’t replace me with Zack.
 Fine, if Zack’s going to be Superman, I want to be Green Lantern.
 You can be Aquaman.
 What are you doing?
 You’re jogging.
Just chill out, Sheldon.
 If it makes you feel any better, when I was dating Penny, she used to flip out on me all the time.
 She didn’t tell you?
 Who else would it be?
 What makes you think I can convince her?
 Okay, let me see if I understand this. You want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize?
 It’s Leonard.
Come on, let me just talk to you.
 Hey.
 Okay, listen. You don’t have to wear the wig. At this party, we’re gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl.
 Did I do something? I mean, I tried to be friends with Zack, like you said, which believe me, was difficult, given how you and me used to be, you know, you and me, and now you and him are you and him.
 Then what are you?
 Not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on New Year’s Eve.
 Green Lantern.
 There’s a big difference. Arrow. Lantern.
 What about me?
 Um, I guarantee you’ll be the prettiest girl there.
 Ten, nine, eight…
 Seven, six…
 Five, four, three…
 Two, one! Happy New Year!
 You’re being a bully.
 What should we do?
 Look, I know our winter thermostat setting is 72 degrees, but I’m a little warm, so I’m going to turn it down.
 I had a great idea. You know how we’re always having to stop and solve differential equations, like when you’re doing Fourier analysis, or using the Schrodinger equation?
 I was thinking, we could write a little app that would use handwriting recognition, and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine. You just use your smartphone, take a picture of the equation and bam!
 Can you say that and not make it sound like I’m a cat who learned how to use the toilet?
 Oh, yay for me. What about you guys? I can’t promise anything, but people do make money off stuff like this.
 I was thinking we could work on this at night, and then maybe in a couple of weeks, we’ll have ourselves an app to sell.
 Yeah.
 I checked the App Store. No one is doing handwriting-recognition differential equation solving.
 What?
 She’s not going to steal our idea.
 We’re gonna write an application…
 It’s not boring at all. You see, in higher order mathematics, there are certain sets of equations that…
 Satisfied?
 That is ridiculous.
 Okay, we need to stop for a minute.
 Sheldon, you’re not in charge. It’s my idea. I’m in charge.
 Well, yes, and you’re listed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.
 Okay. You need to get clear on this right now. I am in charge of this project.
 Thank you. I thought we might start by talking about the user interface.
 So this button here will allow you to scan a new equation, but over here, you can press this, and just substitute new values for the coefficients.
 What?
 It’s not a joke. It’s the real design.
 Sheldon, I think this will work. Let’s just try it my way.
 Are you done?
 We’re not doing names now. Howard?
 No.
 That’s just Sheldon backwards.
 We’re not wasting time with names right now.
 No.
 No.
 Oh Sheldon, stop it.
 That’s enough, Sheldon.
 Okay, that’s it, you’re fired.
 Because you’re impossible to work with.
 What are you doing?
 But I fired you.
 No, you are now nothing. You have no connection to this project whatsoever.
 I don’t want it better. I want it my way.
 What the hell are bus pants?
 Look, I’m still happy to drive you to work. Nothing’s changed in that regard. We’re still roommates, we’re still friends.
 You know what? Go put on your bus pants.
 Hold on. That’s it!
 We’re actually scanning equations and getting good results.
 Howard, did you solve the install time problem yet?
 What are you doing?!
 No. I mean, what are you doing with a theremin?
 Sheldon! We’re working here!
 No, that was completely called for. We need quiet.
 Well, seeing as your project is to sabotage my project, yes.
 I’m telling you, the Lenwoloppali Differential Equation Scanner meets a real need. We’ve got a hit.
 What’s he doing in your apartment?
 Why do you regret, uh, never mind, stupid question.
 We’re not playing. This is real work.
 Then I guess we would let him back on the app team, and while we’re doing that, you could take an aerial tour of L.A. on your flying pig.
 Okay, now that you’re back on the team, let’s get you caught up.
 Thank you. So as you can see, not only can you store your favourite equations, but you can forward them to your friends or post them on Facebook right from the app.
 Thanks.
 It’s an annual science conference. We’ve all been invited to speak.
 I think her weekend just opened up.
 Pretty much. Except we keep our shirts on in the sauna.
 Don’t worry. Just sit next to me during the quiz, and you can copy my answers.
 They’re bigger than mine.
 I can vouch for that.
 Not you, him.
 Although yours was an eye-opener.
 Yeah, hi. Listen, I just got a text from Raj. He wanted me to tell you that when Howard says nap, he means sex.
 Are you an element in the actinoid series?
 It was a late-night vote. We were all exhausted, and he was threatening to filibuster. It’s not technically Road Trip God, it’s Travel Supervisor.
 Shh-shh-shh-shh. Sheldon’s asleep. What’s going on?
 What?
 Uh, sure.
 So, how do you wanna do this?
 Yeah, it is a little like getting into Dracula’s coffin.
 Okay, when you say make the best of it.
 Right. So we’ll just call the middle here the Neutral Zone.
 Star Trek. You know, the Neutral Zone between the Federation and the Romulan Empire.
 Of course, sometimes the Federation and the Romulans would enter the Neutral Zone to negotiate a temporary truce.
 Got it, got it. We can do all kinds of stuff from the waist up, you know?
 Good night.
 No.
 No.
 Sure, no problem.
 True dat.
 I’ve gotten a lot more street since we broke up.
 No. No, I understand. I got too intense, you had to back off.
 I’ve gotten a lot better at that, you know. I’ve dated four different women since we broke up and I didn’t tell any of them that I loved them and wanted to have their babies.
 Okay, good night.
 Penny’s here. No, we don’t want to watch Bridget Jones’s Diary!
 I’d like to kick your little brown ass.
 Oh, I don’t know. Maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend, you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed.
 No!
 Sure.
 No. Why do you ask?
 I found another tweet from a student at Sheldon’s lecture. Dr. Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable. Plus, he looks like a giant insect.
 Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?
 Oh, Sheldon changed the password. It’s now Penny is a freeloader. No spaces.
 Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight. We’re reading the reviews.
 Read this woman’s tweet.
 Yeah.
 In a word, triumphant.
 Really? Triumphant?
 I don’t know, I kind of promised Howard.
 Oh, uh, from the context, we think it means kill me now.
 Yeah, it’s weird. Even though he didn’t want to give the lecture in the first place, being rejected by those students really hit him hard.
 We might be starting to zero in on your problem.
 I’m still not adjusted to how the SyFy channel spells their name now. S-Y-F-Y. That’s siffy.
 Hello? Oh, my God! Is he okay?
 Hang on. Hang on. Uh-huh. Okay, thank you. Howard was on his scooter, and got hit by a truck. He’s in critical condition.
 Have you seen him?
 It’ll be okay. It’ll be okay.
 Or it could be sy-fee.
 S-Y-F-Y. Sy-fee.
 I guess it depends on the zombies, Raj. Are we talking slow zombies, fast zombies? Like, in 28 Days, if those zombies didn’t eat, they starved.
 Oh, Dr. Siebert, twelve o’clock.
 Are you sure this is right?
 Oh. We should get going.
 Really? What do we tell Siebert?
 Thanks.
 More than this?
 He’s tearing the mask off nature to look at the face of God.
 Uh.. b.. d.. uh.. uh..
 Coffee maker?
 On the bright side, I don’t think President Siebert will be making us go to any more fund-raisers.
 Face it, Raj, we crashed and burned tonight.
 Mrs. Latham, the first machine I turn on in the morning is the helium-neon laser, ’cause it needs to warm up.
 You’re kidding. That was good for you? ‘Cause I was sweating through my T-shirt.
 Why?
 Hello, Mrs. Latham. Yes, I live with him. I don’t, I, I really don’t know why. Tonight? Sure, that’d be great. Okay, I’ll, I’ll see you then. Bye. She wants to have dinner and talk about my research.
 Well, wherever we’re going, she’s sending a car to pick me up.
 What?
 Excuse me, but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment. I’ve been published in peer-reviewed journals, I received a Dissertation of the Year award for experimental particle physics.
 That was a great meal.
 The only time I eat this well is when my mom’s in town and she takes me out to dinner.
 You kind of remind me of her. She enjoys making people uncomfortable, too.
 No kidding.
 Yeah, um, so, hey, speaking of money, how are you feeling about helping the physics department get a cryogenic centrifugal pump and molecular sieve?
 Oh, good, good.
 Terrific. Great. What level is that? Okay, now you don’t remind me of my mom.
 Swell. I need a drink. Do we have any alcohol?
 Um, I’m not sure.
 Well, Mrs. Latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump.
 Then she stuck her tongue down my throat.
 She hit on me.
 I think so.
 I was able to get out of there before anything else happened, but she wants to see me again tomorrow night.
 What?
 Well, n-no, hold on a second, I’m not going to sleep with her.
 Well, forget it! It’s not gonna happen.
 I repeat, not gonna happen.
 I won’t be too late. I’m just gonna make a final pitch for the funding and then say good night.
 What’s this?
 I am not going to have sex with her.
 Are you insane? I’m not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment.
 Good night, Sheldon.
 Hey. Hi.
 I’m very hungry. For food, right?
 No, that’s okay.
 Really?
 Oh. Then what was last night about?
 Oh.
 Thank you.
 Oh, don’t say that. You’re a very attractive woman.
 No, it’s true.
 I’m sure I would. But why, why, exactly?
 I hadn’t really given it much thought.
 Do you mean?
 Oh, what the hell.
 What?
 Oh, nothing’s going on. Excuse me.
 Yeah.
 No, I didn’t do it for the money.
 No, I mean, I, I, I got the money first.
 Uh, I’m gonna go lie down.
 I didn’t do it for the money!
 Hey, what’s up?
 Uh, sure. Why?
 Still arguing over which CSI is the best?
 Howard’s gonna sleep here tonight. He had a fight with his mother.
 No.
 Wait, wait. What?
 Priya’s in town?
 Hold on. When did Priya get here?
 Yeah, that’s a real pickle. Bye.
 It’s Leonard.
 I just want to talk to her.
 What are you doing here?
 Why didn’t you call?
 I know. Last time I came on too strong. Can we talk in private?
 The word is forbade.
 Penny, this is Raj’s sister, Priya.
 Really?
 I thought maybe after we eat, we could see an early movie.
 I love the way you say, I’d love that.
 My sister’s 38 and married.
 Oh, come on. It’s not boring at all. She’s currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology. Hmm?
 Oh, wow. I love Taming of the Shrew. I did a paper on it in high school. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail.
 Whose tongue?
 What, with my tongue in your tail?
 Okay, I’m out of here.
 I’m having dinner with Priya at Raj’s. I think Howard’s going to be there. You want to join us?
 Can’t we make a one-time exception for tonight?
 Just come with me to Raj’s.
 It’s not a party. It’s the same group of people who hang out here, hanging out over there.
 How come it’s not a party when we do it here?
 I don’t know what to tell you, Sheldon. I’m going to see Priya. Everyone’s over there. You coming or not?
 I guess you’re right. See you later.
 Come with me to Raj’s and eat there.
 I really doubt that’s what he’ll serve.
 What do you want to do? You want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?
 What?
 So don’t watch TV. Read a book.
 Ugh!
 Right.
 Oh, sounds great.
 Hi.
 Just sit here.
 What you doing?
 You do realize everyone’s eating at Raj’s again tonight?
 You’re having people over?
 Really? LeVar Burton’s coming here?
 Okay, well, tell him I loved him on Star Trek.
 Of course. Good night.
 Yeah?
 Okay.
 It certainly is.
 I am leaving.
 Good-bye, Sheldon.
 Of course I’ll be back. I live here!
 This is delicious. Where’d you learn to make chili?
 I hope she wasn’t anything like my flatmate from Texas.
 Did you know that, per our roommate agreement, I have to wash my feet before I get in the shower? And not in the sink. We each have special buckets.
 Bam. Right in the nose. Made me proud to own a PC.
 Hear, hear.
 Oh, the ancient Romans put spiced toast in their punch bowls.
 He kind of does.
 Aw, hell, I miss him.
 He actually got pretty good. He made us all matching serapes.
 Long before the cats. I think it was around the time he tried to declare our apartment a sovereign nation. I still have some of the currency.
 Hey. I thought you were with your new buddies.
 Cheers.
 Morning.
 Mm-hmm. Great. Hey, can I ask you something?
 Last night, me wanting to try that stuff out of the Kama Sutra, was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?
 Hey, if you can find a book called weird sex with white boys, I’d be okay with that.
 I tried in the seventh grade. I could never get used to them.
 Yeah, if I had contacts I would have been the coolest debate club president ever to be stuffed into his own cello case.
 Th-th-th-that’s okay. I can infer from context.
 Sorry! Oop!
 Sorry! Pardon me! Oh, I’m so sorry! My fault! Check it out. I just got contacts.
 Hey, guys, what do you think? Priya took me clothes shopping.
 Thank you.
 Yeah, good. New contacts. I should have done this years ago.
 Just two. Everyday and dress.
 Oh, my god, you’re breaking up with me! Why would you take me out shopping and then break up with me? That is so cruel.
 Oh, okay. So, what’s up?
 I know. I usually never see my ex-girlfriends, unless their hard drives crash.
 Um, not great, I guess. But Penny and I are just friends.
 No, no-no-no, I’m ready! I gave up the gift of sight for you. If that’s not moving on, what is?
 Oh. Okay.
 No, no, I’m confident. It’s not like I’m unfamiliar with the get lost conversation. Although, this will be the first time I’ll be the one saying it.
 Sure. Oh, god, you smell so good. Of course, that could just be my other senses getting stronger. Hypothetically, if I had access To a Lieutenant Uhura uniform, would you wear it?
 I’m sorry. I’m, never mind.
 Oh, hi.
 One of them’s upstairs. The other one sort of slipped back into my skull.
 Yeah.
 No?
 Yeah.
 Yeah, me, too.
 Yeah, bitches are the worst.
 Uh, Penny, there’s something I have to tell you.
 Okay, uh, how do I put this? Um, are you familiar with Darwin’s observation of the finches in the Galapagos Islands?
 No.
 All right, well, anyway, Darwin observed that when two groups of finches competed over the same food source, eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape so they could feed on something else.
 So what do you think we can learn from that behaviour that we can apply to our own lives?
 Sure, that has birds in it.
 I’m sorry, but I’m gonna count that.
 Yeah. The doctor didn’t want me to rub my eye during the night. It was either this or one of those giant neck cones.
 Oh, yes. Indeed, I did.
 She completely understood everything I said. Case closed.
 Maybe, but that’s not my problem. She’s not my girlfriend, you are.
 Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die, or is that just nature’s way?
 What?
 I am not opening that door, Sheldon.
 Yep.
Nope.
 No.
 Whatcha doin’?
 What’s up with the infrared cameras?
 Holy crap, are you connected to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory?
 Sheldon, that computer is used for National defence. Hacking into it is a Federal crime.
 Okay, I’m leaving before the black helicopters get here.
 Is it racist that I took you to an Indian restaurant?
 Or as you probably call it back home, food.
 No, no, I do. It’s just I knew I was having curry tonight and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time.
 Does that mean you’d relocate here permanently?
Oh,  I love it. Oh, that’s great!
 Small world.
 Of course, I did. I talked and talked and talked.
 Bye.
 It is pretty spicy.
 Oh, okay, it’s not important. It can wait.
 Uh, I kind of have a problem I was hoping you could help me with.
 Move out.
 Well, uh, not far. Hey, if you ever wanna start a family, La Cañada has some great schools.
 Why does it have to be about anything? Can’t a fella ask his buddy to relocate, no questions asked?
 Yes. There, I said it.
 And she likes you.
 Not really, no.
 Well, now, hold on. What kind of distance are we talking about? Because we are neighbours. I mean, I can hear the toilet flush in your apartment.
 I don’t listen for it, but it’s nice to know everything’s okay with your plumbing. The building’s plumbing.
 Well, now hold on, how about this? How about we still hang out, but on the down-low?
 No. I actually felt kinda silly just saying on the down-low.
 Penny, wait. Damned contacts.
 What’s going on?
 Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter. What happened?
 Oh, my God, what did they get?
 You called the police because someone hacked your World of Warcraft account?
 Oh, no, not Glenn?
 Thank you, officer.
 Not the kind with access to drugs.
 Thank you, officer.
 I’m really sorry, Sheldon.
 I don’t know.
 I’m on it. Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is, is Howard there? Okay, thanks. That particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath.
 Hey, Penny. We’re kind of in the middle of a crisis, here.
 Okay, what exactly are we looking for?
 Uh, we are. In the meantime, you’re welcome to whip up a quick character and join us.
 Well, you have to put in a credit card number, but it’s fun.
 We got him. We’re almost done.
 Why don’t we play this smart? Try a little good goblin, bad goblin.
 That’s not where it was going.
 Oh, wait. Hang on. Are you upset?
 Good, good. I’ll tell you what happens.
 Did your sister say anything when you got home last night?
 Come on, help me out. Am I in trouble?
 That’s a relief.
 Really?
 I’ll bet he’s some loser who lives with his parents.
 Hold on, you’re thinking of going there?
 Fine. You walk up to the house, knock on the door and demand your stuff back. What if he says no?
 No one’s getting tortured.
 Oh, geez, I don’t know if I can ditch Priya two nights in a row.
 Aw, screw it. I’m in.
 That’s incredible.
 Uh-oh, that’s Priya.
 Hit the… Hey, sweetie. Yeah, I’m sorry. I’m gonna be working late. I, I, I miss you, too. Okay, sure, I’ll call you when I get home. Okay, bye-bye.
 Cover for me.
 I can’t believe we’re going all the way to San Diego to confront this guy.
 Totally.
 Oh, yeah, I’m feeling it.
 Sheldon, let’s go.
 Okay, let’s get clear on something. We’re just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way. No one’s bat’lething anybody.
 No.
 Come on.
 You’re welcome to try, but the other day, it took you 15 minutes to get into a FedEx box.
 Uh, Sheldon?
 Oh-oh.
 Something’s wrong, I’m not getting any gas. Anybody know anything about internal combustion engines?
 Does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine?
 Well, we’d better call somebody to come pick us up.
 Uh, I kind of told her I was working.
 Yeah, she doesn’t really understand the whole Warcraft adventure-role-playing thing.
 What are you doing?
 Nice shot.
 Perfect.
 Shooting at a target?
 An arrow.
 I’m not going to do that, Sheldon.
 Really? How could you tell?
 You don’t say?
 So, what’s the gossip?
 Fine, don’t tell me.
 Oh. That’s too bad. I wonder what happened.
 Boy, you sure get your money’s worth out of these games.
 – Priya, can I come in?
 Oh, God.
 It’s okay. You didn’t know. I’ll take care of it.
 Sheldon doesn’t allow flossing that close to the mirror.
 It’s a splatter thing. There’s a little piece of tape on the floor you’re supposed to stand behind.
 I know. Just do it. There’s a big inspection coming up, and I don’t want to lose my TV privileges.
 Mm, I don’t know. I get a lawyer, he gets a lawyer, it’s just easier to stand behind the tape.
 Yeah! Dodgers are baseball, right?
 Mm, it’s complicated, but as I remember it, the essentials are, get chosen last, get hit by the ball, cry, go home.
 Well, it might not be a great idea to invite those two.
 Don’t tell anybody I told you, but I heard she might be breaking up with him.
 Really? Who?
 What? You’re kidding!
 Wow, that’s hard to believe.
 Oh, that one doesn’t apply to you. You sit.
 Hey!
 Not too bad. Did you hear about Howard and Bernadette?
 I heard about it from Sheldon. He got it from Amy.
 Do you think a sexually ambivalent Indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than a hundred-pound Jewish guy who lives with his mom?
 I didn’t say Raj. Who said Raj?
 No.
 I can’t say.
 Well, The point is, if this got out, it would destroy Howard and Raj’s friendship.
 You’re the one who told Amy in the first place.
 Oh, yeah? What about it?
 Lucky bastard.
 Whatever it is, we’re here for you. You can tell us anything.
 Marry you?
 Oh, I’d wait.
 Man, he’s going to be blindsided.
 Yeah, Raj, why?
 Hey.
 Hope you’re hungry.
 Will Amy be joining us for dinner?
 Good, good. Everything okay between you two?
 No reason. I was just talking to Raj, and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days.
 No. That’s not what he meant.
 Yeah, you do. You dog, you.
 Pass the soy sauce.
 Oh, hold on, Howard. There’s lots of better times.
 Congratulations!
 That’s great.
 You’re pregnant?
 I can’t hear you, I’m in the shower.
 What?
 I can’t hear you, I’m in the shower.
 What kind of emergency?
 You might not want to do that.
 Sheldon, I’m not alone in here.
 We were in here first, you can’t be in here.
 Yeah, fine.
 Oh. Cool. I’ve got a lawyer. And I’ve seen her naked.
 Top of her class, Cambridge University. Licensed to practice law in three countries. And your face.
 Schooled!
 Superceded!
 No offence, but shower sex with you is now the second best thing that’s happened today.
 I’d like to refer that to my attorney.
 Opa!
 Not as much as you.
 I got you the lamb kabob.
 Morning, Sheldon.
 Why would I want to do that?
 Uh, Captain Kirk activated the self-destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the Enterpriseand kill them both unless he gave in?
 What are you gonna do, Sheldon, blow up the apartment?
 What’s the big deal?
 They’re gonna find out about me eventually, right?
 Are you ashamed of me?
 Then why can’t we tell your parents?
 No, he’s bluffing.
 It’s blackmail!
 This is ridiculous.
 Really?
 Okay, I’ll sign it!
 Come on, Priya, just admit I embarrass you!
 Okay, see you later.
 That is good news. Bye.
 That, that’s brilliant.
 Okay, now I have to ask. What do they do?
 All right.
 Elegant.
 Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you.
 And what?
 Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life.
 Got it. Bye.
 I think he’s getting worse.
 You okay?
 Very pretty.
 Hadn’t really thought about it.
 Uh, sure. Very… prominent.
 Sorry.
 Yeah. How did you know?
 Hi. Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?
 Really? In front of your sister?
 You’re kidding. 3-D?
 Wonder why she didn’t tell me.
 No.
 Well, it’s not as much surprised as, uh, uh, you know, uh. th-th-th-the other thing.
 Well, you know, if you, if, if, if you, uh, I don’t, oh, what’s the word I’m looking for?
 Thank you. Befuddled. The word I was looking for was befuddled.
 I still can’t get over the fact that she got a big movie part. Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend’s up to, ’cause I don’t.
 I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna?
 Thanks, yeah.
 Gals? Who are you, Fred Flintstone?
 I think the word you’re looking for is befuddled.
 Hang on. When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?
 Oh, oh, Beekeeper to King 12. I capture your Pope and release the swarm. Checkmate on Sheldon.
 Uh, that’s my water.
 My water. You’re drinking it.
 Yes. It’s my water.
 Here we go.
 That’s actually my napkin.
 What did your mother say when you told her you were getting married?
 You all right?
 Water nymph.
 What’s going on?
 Have you met Bernadette’s parents?
 That’s not your water.
 Howard and his mother are at the hospital. Come on, we gotta go.
 I don’t know, I just got a text. Come on, hurry.
 Sheldon, let’s go!
 Right, fine. I’ll tell Howard you didn’t come because you’re more concerned about your own well-being than his.
 So, how is she?
 Go sit over there.
 Is there a history of heart disease in your family?
 I’m fine. That’s nice that they’re getting along.
 What are you talking about?
 I don’t care. I don’t have anything to hide.
 No, I do not. You are a mean little man.
 There are a couple of things I did with Penny that might be a little silly, but…
 Every once in a while, before we’d go to bed, I’d put on a little show for her.
 Well, you know, the way I took my clothes off.
 I’d look pretty stupid if there was no music.
 I wasn’t swinging around a pole.
 There was one time I put body glitter on.
 No, she wouldn’t.
 You really are a mean little man.
 Hey, what took you guys so long?
 That’s nice. What about?
 That’s funny.
 It doesn’t matter. I’m the king of foreplay.
 Hell Hounds.
 Sure
 Oh, no, no, no, he doesn’t.
 Well, you have milk in the taters, milk in the gravy, parmesan crust. Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn into a gas-filled Macy’s Day balloon.
 So, no, on the Shepherd’s Pie. Can we move on?
 Sea bass. I’ll have the sea bass.
 Kill me.
 So, what’s your news, Bernadette?
 So, Howard, tell us, how’s it feel knowing that when you two get married, you’ll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?
 Bernadette, that’s great. Howard, do you make a buttload?
 Hey, if I roll down the windows in the car, everything’s peachy. If you do it, you’re still not a doctor.
 You look beautiful, Lieutenant Uhura. Now prepare for inspection.
 Relax, he’s got headphones on. And we’re ten miles above Earth in a starship.
 I can’t believe you think he only wears it on Halloween. Open the landing bay doors, shuttle craft approaching.
 What are you doing here?
 In my bed?
 Oh, you heard?
 Sorry. Does Sheldon know you’re sleeping in here?
 Oh, yeah. Mouth-to-Mouth Mona. You know, she used to date Howard?
 We tried. She doesn’t get along with Sheldon.
 Okay, well, how about this. Until Priya gets her own place, you stay here and I’ll stay at your apartment.
 You? Sure. Bring as many as you want.
 Just not against their will.
 Do you really think you should be eating that cake?
 If you’re gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife, you might want to watch your waistline.
 Until you have kids.
 There’s a reciprocity clause. You get to pull the plug on him, too.
 Bring a ball or a Frisbee, you know, something he can chase.
 No backsies.
 Mmm. Mmm.
 Sorry.
 Oh, come on! Why don’t we just tell them that we’re dating?
 When is the time?
 Fine.
 You’re moving back to India?
 When were you going to tell me about this?
 She’s lying because she doesn’t want you to know we’re dating.
 Well, what difference does it make? If you’re moving back to India, we’re obviously breaking up.
 So. Hot in India?
 Uh. That is a beautiful tapestry.
 What?
 I live here.
 Priya’s going back to India.
 Yes.
 What’s going on?
