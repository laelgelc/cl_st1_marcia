 So, Howard's really in space, huh?
 Must be nice. Nobody wants anything that comes out of me.
 Oh, hey. I was actually just about to close up.
 No, no. It's okay. Hang out.
 Yeah, you're my first customer today.
 I'm, uh, having a nightcap. You want to join me?
 Coffee liqueur in a Chewbacca mug. I call it a sad-tini.
 Hmm. Nice not to drink alone.
 You're kidding.
 Cheers.
 A little music?
 Mmm.
 Yeah. The sun, the waves, the beautiful bodies, tanned and glistening with sweat.
 Yeah.
 No problem.
 Yeah?
 Yeah, I-I'd like to, but I'm a little tight on funds.
 Okay.
 I could do worse.
 Hello.
 Um, Raj invited me to go to the movies with you guys.
 I can take them or leave them.
 Would you feel more comfortable if I ate Raisinets?
 Okay. Should we go?
 All right.
 I went to art school.
 Raisinet?
 Temple of Yip.
 All right, Lesser Demon Turtle.
 We're gonna try to meet some girls.
 Watch out, ladies, a little coffee and cream coming your way.
 No, please don't ruin this for me.
 I like Mark Ruffalo, too.
 I can go thirty.
 Oh, hey, man, welcome back.
 I, I kind of live here now.
 Ah, he's spoiling me and I love it.
 Plus, he doesn't have a girlfriend, I don't have a girlfriend.
 Uh, that sounds a little funny to an American ear.
 Just all of it.
 Raj is taking me to the Sound of Music sing-along.
 So I, I, I'd be sitting by myself during Edelweiss?
 Yeah, yeah. Is he taller?
 Well, Howard, that's very nice of you.
 To Stuart, your comic book store is out of this world. Just like the guy in this picture was.”
 Yeah, it's my annual attempt to meet women. Ninth time's the charm.
 Thanks, but I can't afford je ne sais quois. How much for just quois?
 Really?
 Thank you.
 Oh, yes, thank you. I like to think of fun things like that because I'm fun. I'm not clinically depressed at all.
 Hey, hey, look at you guys!
 Saturday night just went from crazy to epic. Woo-hoo!
 What's wrong with Christmas?
 Do you hear yourself when you say these things?
 Okay, you need to say these things in your head before you say them out loud.
 How does he not hear that?
 I don't remember you buying these miniatures in my store.
 Sure. I get it. Why support a friend when you can support a multinational conglomerate that is crushing the life out of that friend?
 Have you seen my store? The whole place is a toilet.
 That's not good. My character and I both have claustrophobia.
 Oh, boy, happy place, happy place.
 Somebody sing the damn song.
 How did you know that?
 I gotta tell you, this, this is the most holiday fun I've had since my therapist changed my anxiety medication and I stopped caring about the blood in my stool.
 What was so bad about them?
 My carpal tunnel's acting up.
 I take out my skeleton key and run to Santa to unchain him.
 Oh, hey. Could you please stop staring? They're just girls. It's nothing you haven't seen in movies or in drawings.
 What brings you guys here?
 Oh, well, I recommend you don't open a store and sell them.
 Oh, okay. What do you think you might be into? Superhero, fantasy, graphic novels, manga… I swear I will turn a hose on you.
 Um, a little bit of everything. Mostly superhero stuff.
 Shh! You can't ask a question like that in here. Are you trying to start a rumble?
 Well, uh, let's see. You've got your basic clean-cut good guys, Superman, Spider-Man, Captain America. Then you have your darker anti-heroes, your Batman, your Wolverine, Punisher.
 If I were you, I'd go for Fables number one. The artwork is sophisticated, it's intelligently written, and it doesn't objectify or stereotype women.
 Yeah, he kind of is.
 Not really. Other than hiding all the sharp objects around here and white-knuckling it till morning. What do you got going on?
 There must be something we can do.
That actually sounds kind of nice.
 That's good. Or maybe something a little less hand in the pants.
 Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it. In fact, there's no place I would rather be than here.
 Literally anybody.
 What?
 That does sound nice.
 What?
 I know. I hate myself most of the time, but tonight's the night I know everyone else does, too.
 Great.
 Oh, yeah, you left with Raj.
