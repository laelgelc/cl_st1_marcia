 Oh, I see you guys have found my little treasure.
 Oh, it's hard to put a price on something that's a copy of something that was on pay cable. But for my friends, let's say 250?
 Well, it's a limited edition. They only made 8,000 of these bad boys.
 Are you kidding? I'm already giving you the friends and family discount.
 Tell you what, I'll go two thirty-five.
 Okay, two twenty five, my final offer.
 Man, you're killing me!
 Two ten, and I'm losing money.
 Are you crazy? That helmet's signed by Robert Downey Jr.
 Okay, if you're going to question the importance of an actor's signature on a plastic helmet from a movie based on a comic book, then all of our lives have no meaning!
 Thank you. I can eat meat this week.
 You want me to wrap it?
 Ah, hey, Wil.
 Here's the Batman 612 with the Jim Lee alternate cover that you wanted.
 Forty bucks.
 Will there be girls there?
 ‘Cause there wasn't last time.
 Oh, great, more guys. It's gonna be another Wil Wheaton sausage-fest.
 Hot girl, nine o'clock. Don't everybody look at once!
 I don't know, she might be lost. Doesn't matter. Watch and learn. Hi.
 Um… it-it-it… Shut up.
 ‘Cause if you did, you get your picture up there on the Wall of Heroes.
 Doesn't matter. This is the closest anyone's ever come. You're going on the wall, my friend.
 Can I help you find anything?
 Sorry. Most of the guys who come in here like big boobs. Couple of them have big boobs.
 Leonard, what's the deal with Sheldon's friend Amy? Are they a couple?
 Well, I mean, she didn't look through me with soul-sucking, ball-shriveling hatred and contempt. I like that in a woman. Could you run it by Sheldon if I could ask her out?
 If I tell you that, I'm robbing you of the hours of fun you could have for the magical, rootin' tootin' low price of $24.95.
 I'll ring it up. Like shooting nerds in a barrel.
 If you're bored, you can go. I understand.
 Don't patronize me.
 Hi, Sheldon.
 None taken. Although repellent is kind of a, kind of a strong word.
 Um, again…
 So, other than you taking your relationship to the next level with another guy, this was nice.
 Oh, you're welcome.
 Good night.
 Oh, hey, Sheldon. Can I help you find something today?
 Ninth?
 Uh, not so good. My shrink just killed himself and blamed me in the note.
 Yeah.
 Yes.
 No.
 I'm sorry, you want me to take you to the dentist?
 Sheldon, I'm working. I can't take you to the dentist. Also, and I can't stress this enough, I don't want to take you to the dentist.
 Hey Sheldon. Help you with anything?
 Uh, I don't know. Could put a tennis ball on the end of Excalibur. Make a pretty badass cane.
 No.
 Hmm. Oh, have this collectors edition Batman utility belt. Maybe she can use it as a wearable pill caddy.
 I'm sorry Sheldon, that's it. That's all I got.
 Hey, uh, Leonard, things are a little tight at the comic book store. I might need some help covering my share of the check.
 And maybe a few bucks for the valet.
 And gas money to get home.
 Great. You know what? This is my grandfather's watch.
 18-carat gold, got it in Europe during the war.
 Mm-hmm. A hundred bucks and it's yours.
 For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny.
 You want to buy a watch?
 Hear! Hear!
 To Howard.
 Okay, I'll go. Howard, when I think about you and Bernadette starting this wonderful life together, I can't help but get a little choked up. I mean, look at you. You have everything. Look at me. I'm 37. I sleep in the back of a comic book store, and I have the bone density of an 80-year-old man. To Howard.
 Hear, hear.
