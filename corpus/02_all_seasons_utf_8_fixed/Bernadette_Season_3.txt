Microbiology.
I don’t understand.
I know, I’m studying it.
Are you sure?
No.
Like in the bedroom or like Dungeons and Dragons?
No.
Not really.
I use them. I don’t like them.
A puppy once bit my face.
Are you going to answer it?
I know how you feel. My mother makes me crazy.
Oh, yeah? Does your mother call you every day at
work to see if you’ve had a healthy lunch?
Okay, well, does she lay out your clothes for you
in the morning like you’re nine years old?
No. That’s the sad part.
That’s nothing. I couldn’t ride a bicycle because my mother
was afraid I’d hit a bump and lose my virginity.
Not on a bicycle. In a Camry.
Oh!
I’d love some.
Why?
Okay, but only if you come to Sunday dinner at
my house wearing a yarmulke.
I don’t really get it.
Can I ask you a question?
Where do you think this is going?
You’re so funny. You’re like a stand-up comedian.
Actually, I think a lot of them are Jewish.
Look, Howard, this is our third date and we both
know what that means.
Sex.
But I need to know whether you’re looking for a
relationship or a one-night stand.
Maybe you need to think about it a little.
Call me when you figure it out.
Hello, Howard.
I can’t now, I’m working.
Is this more comedy that I don’t understand?
So, this isn’t a joke?
Then you’re insane.
Howard, we’ve only been on three dates. We haven’t even
had sex yet.
Wow.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, now what?
No, that’s okay.
Are you kidding? That’s the most romantic thing anyone’s ever
done for me.
I don’t think I can. I don’t have Howard’s street
cred.
What?
Why not?
He can’t sit somewhere else?
Ooh, I love your shoes.
Where’d you get them?
I’ve been meaning to go over there.
Don’t take him too seriously, a lot of what he
says is intended as humour.
Me neither, but he just lights up when I laugh.
So, Leonard, Howard says you’re working on fundamental tests of
quantum mechanics.
Oh, I find it fascinating. If I hadn’t gone into
microbiology, I probably would have gone into physics. Or ice
dancing.
That’s amazing.
Are you going to try to set up the voltages
using tunnel junctions?
Oh, yeah, show me. In microbiology, the most exciting thing
I get to work with is yeast.
Who are all those people?
Hi.
He doesn’t mean salt mines. He means where he works.
So, how’s your experiment going?
Boy, I’d love to see that.
Really? Oh, that’d be great. How exciting is that?
Do they have that?
Oh. You got me again. This isn’t non-fat yogurt, this
is fatty fat fat. Excuse me.
Sure.
Howard?
It unhooks in the front.
I guess I should go.
Let me just put that on vibrate.
You know, that one I got. Howard, did you say
something to Leonard about me?
He says if I go see his experiment tomorrow it
might weird you out.
You’re not jealous of Leonard, are you?
Are you saying I need to ask your permission to
hang out with Leonard?
Hey, Leonard. Am I too late to see the experiment?
Oh, hi.
What are you doing here?
No, you didn’t. You said Leonard’s experiment was stupid.
No, Leonard, you should hear this.
What do you think, Leonard? Should I give him another
chance?
Come here, tushy face.
Raj, you should’ve seen Leonard’s experiment. The interference pattern was
so cool when the electron beam was on.
Oh, yeah, I’m starved. When you spend all day in
a bio-lab, watching flesh-eating bacteria skeletonize small rodents it really
works up an appetite.
Oh, we’re way past second base. Right, Howard?
How’s your work going, Penny? Any acting jobs?
I’m sliding into third.
So, what should we talk about?
No, thank you.
Really uncomfortable.
Oh, my God, have you ever been so embarrassed?
I don’t know which was lamer, their roller-skating or their
disco dancing.
When Howard tried to do the splits…
With marbles?
Sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?
Okay, Sheldon. What happens to our neuroreceptors when we don’t
get enough REM sleep?
Which leads to…?
Right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go
to bed.
I’m going to count to three. One…
I know how to deal with stubborn children. My mother
used to run an illegal day care centre in our
basement.
Thanks, Sheldon.
