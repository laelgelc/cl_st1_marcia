Howie, stop. I can’t talk like that. Amy’s right here.
The hotel’s nice. There’s a pool, a gym, the bar
looks like fun.
Aw, I love you, too. If I don’t talk to
you before you go to sleep, I’ll meet you in
dreamland.
I was thinking of going to the lecture on posterior
cingulate cortex lesions in the formation of autobiographical memory.
To the advancement of science.
This is fun, we never really get to talk shop
with Penny around. We usually just end up talking about
boys.
Be cool.
You’re right. Thank you.
It’s fine. I thanked them again and let them know
we’re not available.
Yes, it’s all cool. Although, if you wanted to talk
to one of them, no one would blame you.
I don’t know what I’m saying.
Boy, these drinks are strong. Hoo, mama, I’m gonna be
huggin’ the toilet tonight.
I just meant that you’re not married and your boyfriend’s
kind of, Sheldon.
Sorry. I have no point. That was a stupid thing
to say. Can we please just go back to having
a nice time?
Come on. I apologize. Can we please just let it
go?
Thanks.
Good night.
Yeah, that felt nice.
So, hypothetically, if, if we were to have gone with
them, which one would you have picked?
Oh, good, because I liked the tall thin one. He
seemed intelligent, kind of a loner, maybe a little sexually
inexperienced, like I’d have to teach him a thing or
two.
Your short sexed-up guy kind of sounds like Howard.
Good night.
Hi, honey.
I made some brownies. You want one?
We are. Stop it. And for the last time, you’re
not fat.
Fine, forget I asked. How was dinner at your mom’s?
Why can’t she do it?
Let me see. How long have you been putting this
on her?
This is really strong oestrogen cream. Please tell me you’ve
been wearing gloves.
Howie, the oestrogen’s getting absorbed by your skin. That’s why
you’ve been all bloated and moody and a giant pain
in the ass.
That’s because I’m a woman. I’ve had years of practice
riding the dragon.
It’s still gonna take a few weeks for the hormones
to leave your system.
It’s okay. You still look great to me. In fact,
why don’t we go in the bedroom and I’ll prove
it to you?
Oh, that happened right after you left.
Maybe we can do it next week.
Should we just do couples?
Faster, faster, faster! Do you not know that word? It
means more fast!
Hey, you’ll know when I’m yelling at you.
Come on, numb nuts, it’s the comic book store.
Because you’re in the right lane behind a bus and
you won’t go around it? I’m sure she finds it
charming.
I’m starting to think she dodged a bullet. The slowest
bullet in the world.
Yeah, I know. Its, it’s probably because I grew up
with five brothers and sisters so I had to fight
for every… Oh, my God, you did not just slow
down for a bird, you know they fly, right?
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go! How am I faster than
you? I’m in heels and I stopped to take a
phone call.
Hey, Romeo. Repair your relationship on your own time.
I knew it, we’re gonna lose.
Congratulations, you got it last.
Don’t sweat it, my dad’s a cop. He can fix
things.
Your kid may be an honour student but you’re a
moron.
Who cares? Focus on the game.
No. Quitting would be the worst thing for your relationship.
Because it would make you seem like something she already
thinks you are.
How do I put this? She’s been known to call
you a name that usually applies to a lady part.
Or a cat. Or a willow.
If you’re gonna cry about it there’s tissues in my
purse. Unless you got some in yours. Big willow.
Can you reach the clue?
Hurry, Sheldon and Penny were right behind us in the
bowling alley.
Great, climb back up. Come on.
Let’s go.
They’re here first. This is because you made me slow
down for that blind guy.
No, she doesn’t. I just made that up.
Because you were about to quit like a big, Sheldon,
cover your ears.
Wish I had a man like her on my team.
Maybe the spot’s the clue.
Stop her, Leonard, stop her.
Then where’s the coin?
You suck so hard.
You were really quiet during dinner. Is everything okay?
Yeah, I bet it sucked. I’m gonna take a bath,
you do the dishes.
Here’s what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna take a bath, and
you’re gonna do the dishes.
Aw, poor Howie. We good? I’m gonna take a bath.
God, what is going on with you?
And I’m not buying it. Try again.
Strike two.
Howard.
So, Amy, what are you gonna be working on at
Caltech?
If they’re anything like humans, the answer’s yes.
You mean like death row inmates with nothing to lose?
No, that would be unethical.
He’s never gonna stop doing that, is he?
He said what?
Excuse me, I need to have a chat with my
husband.
Well?
What exactly do you think you’d get sick of?
Is it my voice? Am I too bossy? What?
That’s the wrong arm for a heart attack, doofus.
Like looking me in the eye and lying to me?
Find somewhere else to sleep tonight.
Hi.
I may have overreacted.
It’s just sometimes I feel like you enjoy spending time
with your friends more than with me.
It’s not? You spend all day together at work, and
then you all hang out at night playing games, going
to the comic book store. Last week, you two got
a couples massage. So, when you said you wouldn’t want
to spend that much time with me, it really hurt
my feelings.
Why tomorrow?
No!
I’m not apologizing to Howard. He can come beg me
on his knees.
Great news. A raccoon virus just crossed the species barrier
and now can infect humans.
In the pharmaceutical business we have a saying, mo’ infections,
mo’ money.
Oh, calm down. If I had it, I’d be dead
already.
Well, let’s just say the next time you move a
dozen vials of raccoon virus to the fridge, make two
trips.
Yeah, it’s just a precaution. If there was a problem,
I’d be throwing up out of my eyeballs by now.
Sorry I messed up our date.
What’s all this?
Howie.
Oh, Howie.
Howie, that was amazing. Look, I’m shaking.
Howie, stop. Come on, look at what I’m making.
Me, too.
Hi.
Oh, sure, so it’s fine when you say it.
Maybe you should master glue before you move on to
fire.
He’s kidding. If that were true, it’d be so much
bigger.
Penny, can we please get our drinks?
Cool. At my lab, I performed ten laser capture micro-dissections.
That’s Lucy?
I think that reason’s called racism.
Why? What are you gonna say?
You because you just called him your Indian friend.
No, but we knew that.
We did, you never brought it.
So, how are you gonna tell Raj abut what you
did?
Then you made her cry and leave.
If this girl hurt you so much, are you sure
you want to see her again?
Well, if you’re sure you want to do this, it’s
only coffee, just relax and see what happens.
Sure.
Maybe, if she asks.
I’d save that for the second date.
Hi, Dad.
Oh, you brought beer for everybody.
You can have a quiet day and watch the game
here.
I guess we’re gonna have to do all the cooking.
If you think you’re gonna make me do all this
by myself, you’re crazy.
Oh, well, that’s a great idea.
Thanks for saving the day.
I’ll help Raj in here. Why don’t you go keep
my dad company?
Don’t be silly, he loves you.
Okay, he cares about you a lot.
I do crap for you all the time. Get out
there.
What?
What?
I don’t know. He’s sweet, he’s tall, handsome.
How’s it going out there?
What are they doing?
So why don’t you do that with them?
What do you mean?
Sorry. I really want to hear how sad you are.
I’ll be back in like five, ten minutes.
Ooh.
Hey. Howie says you’ve been making fun of him all
day. Now, both of you apologize right now.
It’s okay.
Thanks again for cooking.
Want to pause the video game and help me clean
up?
Come on, it’s your friend who’s coming to stay here.
Howie.
The rest of the week? You said it was just
gonna be a night or two.
No.
I love Raj, but that’s a long time for a
house guest.
He’s bringing Cinnamon?
Hey, guys. Sorry I’m so late. Did you already have
dinner?
Aw, that’s so sweet.
Oh, Raj, you’re our guest.
Thank you, Raj.
Okay, um, well, first, I was late to a meeting
because I was stuck in traffic.
Thank you.
Aw! Raj did the dishes.
Because once, when all the knives were dirty, you cut
a bagel with your keys.
Aw, you didn’t have to do that.
What presentation do I have today?
Raj, this dinner was amazing. If you’re here much longer,
I’m gonna have to buy bigger clothes.
Aw. Howie, how come you never say anything sweet like
that?
Maybe you could try being more thoughtful, like your friend
Raj.
Oh, really?
Like I don’t do enough around here. Now I need
to pack your lunch? And by the way, why do
you need a note telling you to go get them?
You’re a grown man, you should know to go get
’em.
This is stupid. Why are we fighting?
You’re not a lousy husband. You’re a great husband. I
was the one feeling like a lousy wife.
Yeah, we were totally fine half-assing our marriage till you
showed up.
I back you up all the time.
What is wrong with you?
Good idea, I’ll take a picture.
Hi.
Hey, I brought over It’s a Wonderful Life if you
guys want to watch it later.
But then he gets to see what the world would
be like if he’d never been born.
Well…
Hey, Penny, can I take that table?
The one in the turtleneck is cute.
Never mind.
You know, I was thinking. Without Sheldon, most of us
would have never met, but Penny would still live across
from him.
Hey, how come you three never got an apartment together?
Aw, so I guess if it weren’t for me, you’d
still be living with her, huh?
How is this any different?
Hey, so how come you two didn’t move in together?
You actually got him to do it.
Raj, when you said you were gonna bring a date
to watch Penny’s thing tonight, I didn’t think you meant
Stuart.
Well, Stuart’s cute in his own way.
Or maybe just stop talking.
Or just keep dating the possum.
What happened?
Hey.
That’s interesting.
If you want him to stop, sometimes the easiest thing
to do is just fake a laugh.
No, of course not.
I don’t think you would.
How many times do I have to tell you to
replace the toilet paper when it’s empty?
So am I.
Hey Stuart.
Sorry. Did I startle you?
Well, I need a little help. I accidentally destroyed one
of Howard’s comic books this morning, and was hoping I
could replace it.
Batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron.
Do you have this one?
Ooh, I was kind of hoping to get it before
Howie comes home from work.
Well, he’s always saying I should be more careful with
my curling iron, and it seems like a dangerous precedent
to let him think he can be right.
You know, I do work at a pharmaceutical company. If
you can make this happen today, I can hook you
up with anxiety medication, antidepressants.
Oh, that’s great.
Oh, that’s terrible. What’s the address?
Oh, thanks, but I don’twant you to close up. I
mean, won’t you lose business? Sorry. That was mean.
Wow.
No, thanks.
Hey.
I don’t think I like the way you’re treating my
friend.
Not from you. Let’s go, Stuart.
Yes, I am, there’s a few more things I want
to say to you. Stuart’s store is just fine, and
he’s a much nicer person than you are, and if
you still have that comic, I’d like to buy it
right now.
No, I don’t want a latte. I want a cappuccino
and a blueberry scone.
Well, that sounds even better.
Those tickets were pretty expensive. I had to give Howie
an advance on his allowance. Now he’s never gonna put
his toys away.
Well, while they’re acting like teenagers, we could do something
grown-up.
Oh, I know. There’s a nice hotel not far from
here where they do afternoon tea.
La-dee-da, look who has clean underwear.
I can’t believe the waiter thought I was your daughter.
That’s cute.
Should we leave?
I could go for a drink.
Honestly, I thought when I got married I would, but
I still kind of feel like I’m pretending. It doesn’t
help that most of my clothes come from Gap Kids.
Yeah. Or you’d be the oldest one here.
Well, for starters, we’d be splitting this check three ways.
Are you sure you guys don’t want to come with
us to Napa? You could probably still get a room.
I’m gonna fix this right now.
Excuse me. You are at Valentine’s dinner with your girlfriend.
Now get back over there and be with her.
Great. Now there’s two of ’em.
Well, just the fact that you got him up here
still says a lot. To be honest, I bet Howie
200 bucks it wasn’t gonna happen.
See? It’s not just Sheldon. They’re all idiots.
So, your boyfriend’s a fixer-upper. Most of them are. I
mean, look at this guy. You think he came like
this? When I met him, he was a hot, goofy
mess. Now, he’s been to space. That’s all me.
Oh, sure you did. Who’s Mama’s big space man?
I love you, too.
Sorry.
Oh, that sounds so romantic.
Let’s go.
Guys, you’re being childish.
Have you guys ever thought about getting a dining room
table?
Hey.
Fine. Can I at least shower first?
What are you talking about?
Wow. Well, what did you say?
Well, it’s just, after last time, I didn’t think you’d
ever want to go back.
Really? Because I kind of remember a lot of complaining
and wishing for it to be over.
Yeah, exciting. Can I ask you something?
He hated that entire experience. Does it make me an
awful wife if I don’t think he should do it
again?
So you’ll talk to him?
Well, I’m his wife, I don’t want to ruin it
for him.
Since when am I the buzzkill?
No, I think it’s stupid.
You’re right, it’s great.
Hi, honey.
Maybe you should have a seat.
Daddy.
I think what we’re all trying to say is, you
don’t seem to be remembering how traumatic the experience was
for you.
Don’t forget all the other astronauts picking on you.
Yeah, it’s fun up here.
Now I feel bad.
No, it just seems silly for us to sit in
two groups.
Look at Amy down there. Should we go?
Come on, Raj, it’s not the same without you.
Raj, your tag’s sticking out.
Now I feel a little gross.
Serial Ape-ist? I thought you died in that.
Can I ask you something? Why do you constantly feel
the need to put down my husband?
That was ten years ago.
What are you doing?
This is gonna be a long weekend for you.
I said to stop insulting each other. I didn’t tell
you to take him on a romantic getaway.
Hi.
You excited for Texas?
I did. His talk at NASA went great.
No, in fact, he was so well-behaved, Howie bought him
a Buzz Aldrin bobble head and astronaut ice cream.
Hi, Stuart.
Well, I told Howie if I wasn’t busy, I’d spend
the night at his mom’s. So for God’s sake, think
of something.
I didn’t know his last name was Bloom.
All right, if I’m doing this, I’m playing to win,
so just to be clear, if we’re ourselves, that means
one of us killed Stuart?
What is that, like, the Indian Sherlock Holmes?
What do you care? You’re dead.
So, what happens next?
I didn’t know you were fat.
Hey, what about this? It looks like a receipt.
For a cup of coffee. But it’s dated 20 years
from now.
So one of us went back in time to kill
Stuart?
So I guess you two are making it work long
distance.
Speak for yourself. Last month, my company both invented and
cured Restless Eye Syndrome. Ka-ching, ya blinky chumps.
What the hell?
Penny did it, I win. Suck it, jackasses.
I liked the time travel element.
Well, I hope 20 years from now, we really are
all still together and still friends.
Aw.
Can I get your opinion on something that happened at
work today?
Okay, well, I did something that will either make me
look like a lovable goof or a horrible monster damned
to spend eternity in hell.
Well, there’s this lady in our office who’s retiring, and
they were passing around one of those big cards for
us to sign.
But no one told me she was in a horrible
car accident over the weekend and what I was signing
was not a retirement card but was actually a get
well card.
So on the card, in the hospital, next to the
woman who’s clinging to life are the words, “Hey, Vivian.
You deserve this. And at least with you gone, no
one will steal my yoghurt out of the fridge.”
“LOL.” Smiley face.
“P.S. Good luck wherever you wind up.”
Am I a terrible person?
Am I a terrible person that it crossed my mind
that she might die and never see the card?
I’m so sorry.
Are you gonna take it?
I like the Wii.
Yes.
What do you mean, yes?
Were you seeing other women when we started dating?
No.
Poor thing, she was in surgery for 18 hours. She’s
alive, but she’s still in critical condition.
The one bit of good news is they put her
in a medically induced coma before she read the card.
So, you know, silver linings.
Yes.
I’m excited to meet Emily.
Why would you say that?
How?
Hi.
Emily, what do you do?
Yeah, what happened?
Please don’t say it.
Howie.
So, Emily, why did you decide to specialize in dermatology?
You’re kidding, right?
Howie, we moved on a long time ago.
We moved on.
How’s your soup?
Where are you going?
We kind of just wanted one night where we didn’t
have to hear about how miserable you are making this
movie.
I’d tell you what I do with Howard, but I
don’t think dressing up like a Catholic schoolgirl is gonna
work with Sheldon.
Of course.
Between Penny’s gorilla movie and Howard’s gorilla mother, I had
no choice.
Oh, we know you don’t lie to her.
Yeah, honey, I’m still stuck at work. Really? Penny said
that? Okay, it’s true. I’m sorry. I’ll see you at
home. Yeah, yeah, I’ll put it on.
I gotta go. Penny ratted me out. FYI, she’s getting
you a watch for your birthday with money she took
out of your wallet.
Me, too. Although, it might’ve been thoughtless of us to
bake a Death Star cake.
Well, anyway, it’ll be a nice surprise for the boys.
And Howie doesn’t think I take his interests seriously, so
hopefully this will keep him fooled for a while.
This is pretty cool. You don’t see too many spherical
cakes.
No. My dad controlled the TV, so unless someone was
a Texas Ranger, Jake or the Fatman, we didn’t see
it.
Not me. I got into science because I was always
the smallest kid in school, so I thought if I
became a scientist, I could invent a formula that made
me taller.
Yeah, I thought it was working for a while, but
then I found out my brother was just lowering the
pencil marks on the door frame. How about you?
Girl Sprouts?
How did that get you into science?
Happy Star Wars Day.
And even though it meant we had to miss the
movies, we could still be part of the fun.
Son of a bitch.
Almost there. You’re doing great.
We set it up in Howie’s old room.
Maybe we should get one of those machines to help
her up the stairs.
Howie.
Taking care of your own mother? How can you say
that?
I would do it for my mother.
Look, I’m not crazy about the idea, but what other
choice do we have?
You’d hire a total stranger to take care of the
woman who raised you? That’s so cruel.
You are a putz.
You know, you’re always talking about having a baby someday.
This is exactly what it’s gonna be like.
Come on. The constant fussing, eating, pooping, burping, drooling. We’re
even waiting for the day when she can finally walk
on her own.
I’m just telling you now, if we do have kids,
don’t expect me to do all the work.
Howie, I’m back!
Sorry.
They only had regular yoghurt. I had to go to
a different store to get the extra-fat kind your mom
likes.
So what? After two days of taking care of her,
excuse me for stopping to get a mocha.
Queen? I’ve been killing myself here.
I’m glad I got that mocha. And you know what
else I’m glad about? I bought you a brownie and
I ate it in the car.
Last night was a little rough, but I think we’re
gonna get through this.
Me, too.
You were right.
She’s just so impossible, they keep quitting.
Hey!
You guys propose all the time. This never happens.
I know you’ve only been here a day and a
half, but you’re like part of the family. I don’t
think the service is gonna send any more people.
That’s not helpful.
But we have jobs. We can’t baby-sit her 24 hours
a day.
I wanted to go to Hawaii, not hell.
Howie, I love you, and as your wife, your mother
is every bit as much my problem as she is
yours, so, I want a divorce.
Sorry I’m late. The leaf blower broke, so I had
to hand-dry my mother-in-law.
Thanks. Little warning before you jump into this marriage business.
You’re not just marrying him, you’re marrying his family.
It doesn’t matter if she’s okay with you. The question
is, can she go to the bathroom by herself? Hit
me again.
You’re not working. How would you like a job in
home health care?
Please. I’m desperate.
I’ll pay you anything you want.
I could’ve ridden a bull longer than that.
So, she’s not too much for you?
Yeah. I don’t know why, but something about it feels
unnatural.
Yep.
