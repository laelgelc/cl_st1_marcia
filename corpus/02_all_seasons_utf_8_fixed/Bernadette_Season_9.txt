Our pleasure. You feeling okay?
Howard.
For God's sake, Sheldon, what are you doing?
Howard, do something.
Sheldon, shh. The wedding's starting.
Aw, that was beautiful.
No, we totally won.
Amy.
I know it hurts now, but it's gonna get better.
That's true.
What happened? They just got married.
Think they'll break up?
Hands off. I'm mad at you.
What will pay for itself?
I'm mad at you for blabbing to me what Leonard
did on the North Sea, and I'm mad that I've
had to hide this from Penny for two years.
I mean, if Penny finds out I've known all this
time and haven't told her, she's gonna think I'm a
terrible friend. I wish you never told me.
I guess that's true.
I don't know what to think. But then again, I
just found out about it.
Oh, I don't know. This is all so new to
me. I'm still processing.
You know, if you think about it, without you, he
never would've grown into the person he is now. I
mean, sure, more women might notice him, but I think
it's better to have a guy be with you because
he wants to be and not because he thinks he
doesn't have any other choice.
Oh, me neither, not until just now.
Come on, Leonard's doing bachelor stuff. You sure we can't
take you to a strip club?
Oh, look, Jewish and gentile.
I hope the boys don't get too crazy in Mexico.
You guys still aren't living together?
Speaking of Sheldon, how's single life treating you?
Good for you.
Good for you.
Your sweater?
Your hair?
You really never had that done?
We'll take you to the mall to get it done.
This party's weird.
Amy, I noticed your status still says in a relationship
on Facebook.
Did you change yours to married yet?
What?
What about your sister's wedding?
Yeah, isn't it gonna get worse the longer you wait?
That's a joke, right?
Bet she'd still tell her if she got married.
It's understandable. Amy was afraid to tell her mom she
broke up with Sheldon.
Okay, Amy, your turn.
What did we do?
Really? They didn't eat him?
The breakfast meat family?
Of course.
Aw. I'm honoured.
So, I'm your seventh choice.
How can I help you?
Well, why don't you look at this as an opportunity?
You had other roommates before Leonard. Maybe this is a
chance to find someone new.
Hey. You know who would be the perfect roomie?
Stuart. He's been living with us for a while now.
I'm sure he'd love to get us out of his
hair.
Well, Sheldon's looking for a roommate.
He'll think about it.
I can't believe Sheldon asked you to be his roommate.
Hey, if you're open to living with someone great, I'll
give you a thousand dollars to take Stuart.
I'm sorry. I just thought you might have a pasty,
weirdo-shaped hole in your life.
Sure. So how can we help?
You are.
Was it?
That really happened?
Stuart took that rejection like a pro.
Oh, you get used to it. Some guys you have
to turn down over and over.
Oh. Look at you, two guys in one day.
What did he say?
What can it hurt?
You mean, not a scientist?
Are you attracted to him?
Yeah.
Walk.
Howie?
Why does your Fitbit say you ran 174 miles yesterday?
Hey, you know who went out on a date the
other night? Stuart.
I thought so, too.
He's using some kind of dating app on his phone.
I don't know. Stuart, can you come in here? He
tried to explain it to me. It shows you pictures
of people nearby, you swipe them around, it looks kind
of like a game.
Can you show us that dating app?
Oh, what would make you give a girl a thumbs
down?
Yeah, Stuart got two dates with it.
Doesn't a teardrop tattoo mean he murdered someone?
Hey, I thought you were gonna be out late?
We put Amy on a dating app, and we're seeing
what's out there.
Ew, check out his tiny teeth. He looks like a
man-dolphin.
And I'd love to take you out again?
Yeah, why wouldn't you tell us?
What?
I, I thought you weren't ready to start seeing people.
And how many guys have you gone out with?
Hey. You got a minute?
Pause the game, Howard.
We need to talk about redecorating this place.
Look, I get that you grew up here and you're
attached to things looking a certain way, but I want
this to feel like my house, too.
All right. Let's start over. I'm redecorating. The furniture, the
carpeting, the walls. I'm changing everything that depresses me when
I look at it. Try not to be one of
those things.
Is it about how I can't have new wallpaper because
your dad left when you were little and your mom
died?
Whatcha doing?
Okay, listen, I'm thinking that maybe we can compromise on
the house.
Let's just redo one room and see how it goes.
How about this one?
Then how about the bathroom?
Fine. Then the dining room.
Great. I'm gonna go pick out paint samples.
Hey, Raj. Dad and I were just talking about taking
down this wall.
Seriously? You brought Raj over to take your side?
He's not on my side. He's doing all the work
for free.
Earthquake.
Aftershock.
So I should probably explain why I kind of fibbed.
I told my dad that you were the one who
didn't want kids because I didn't want to disappoint him.
Turns out yeah, I didn't think twice about it.
Oh, please. Mom did everything. All you did was come
home from work, sit on the couch and drink beer.
How is that raising kids?
Why?
Okay, I'll think about it.
It's an actual I'll think about it.
I know you would.
Yeah, it's your third date, maybe you could go more
sexy.
Ooh, tall. Finally some details about this mystery man.
Did you kiss him yet?
Tea and basketball?
Oh, nice.
Hey, you want to swing by that place tonight and
get a look at this guy?
I'll just call the restaurant, pretend I'm Amy and check
the reservation.
Yeah, but I'm little, so it's adorable.
Across the street, in the left window.
Right here.
Kinda. Before I met Howie, I liked to keep close
tabs on my boyfriends.
No. Stalkers are creepy. I'm just a harmless little girl
with military-grade spy equipment.
He's cute, right?
Yeah, I should've brought my parabolic microphone.
Nothing. Not important.
I took a video. I forgot how much fun this
is.
Why'd you bring him?
Ugh, I hear that.
Right here.
Hey, hey, they're leaving.
We got to get out of here.
He and his tiny bladder can take the bus.
Hi, Ames, what are you doing here?
And Raj and I are volunteering at the soup kitchen,
feeding food to the homeless.
You said that sounded like the worst thing ever.
The soup kitchen manager assigns the jobs, and the shifts
are six hours.
We are, and I believe the word you're looking for
is yu-huh-huh-huh.
Hi. We'd like to volunteer.
Oh. Okay. Wipe that smug smile off your face.
That he's an ass? He beat you to it.
Oh, great. We'd love to help.
I can't.
What difference does it make?
I'll do it.
Happy Thanks… Yikes.
So, you're really going out with Dave again?
But he spent an entire date talking about how much
he loves Sheldon.
Okay. So where's he taking you?
Oh. That's a big step.
Yeah. You're inviting him into your home. It's intimate. It's
where your underpants live.
You sure? You've never really been with a man. Do
you really want to start with one that's six-foot-seven?
Because it's like taking your driver's test in a bus.
Who's Trent?
Fan of what?
You mean because you played one time in the comic
book store?
Are you stalking him? That's creepy.
Maybe I should marry Trent.
What happens if I say, come in?
Come in.
Just come in.
Sure.
How about something a little more realistic?
Hold on. It could be romantic. The two of them
away together, keeping each other warm in snowy Wisconsin.
Wild thang.
Yeah, are you ready for this?
So where do you want to go?
Great. And then maybe after, we can watch a dirty
movie, and if anybody has any questions about what happened
or how, we can answer them.
We don't want to spoil anything, but you should know
that Sheldon said he's ready to be physical.
Well, we're really happy for you, and we know how
much he cares…
No, they're not.
Do you think Sheldon's actually gonna go through with it?
Yeah, but he also swore this was the year he'd
be able to pull the guts out of a pumpkin.
It was. I just wish Stuart wasn't around so we
didn't have to be so quiet.
No, it's okay.
So, when are you thinking of moving?
Oh. Okay. Sorry to see you go?

Great. I can finally show you where the laundry room
is.
Nobody thought that.
I guess so.
Ignore him. He's just using humour to express how happy
he is.
Sure he does. Well, let us know when you're all
settled in.
Our pleasure.
Goodbye.
Boy, when was the last time Stuart cleaned this place?
Howie, I don't want to play Lego, Toenail or Pill
anymore. So, what do you think we should do with
this room?
Why can't it be a woman cave?
I'm being serious.
I don't know, maybe a home office or, oh look.
The teddy bear Stuart won the night we took him
to the fair.
Yeah. You know, no matter how hard they tried, they
could not guess his age.
Have you heard from him since he left?
Hmm. Maybe he's busy.
No, that's not what this feeling is. Is it?
And he tried to deny it, but his teeth were
all purple.
Yeah. Ew, we are missing him!
Maybe he uses Kryptonite.
We could do a double feature with the Leonardo Di
Caprio Romeo and Juliet.
I brought you a little care package from work. It's
our latest antiviral and the best decongestant we make.
You're gonna want to take these with food.
Forgiven, forgiven.
And he made it all better.
You know what that means.
This is so cool.
Ooh, work that thing.
Okay, so you met this girl, you exchanged numbers, and
you're gonna meet up with her.
Oh. Well, I guess that's not so bad.
I'm sure it was harmless. People flirt. No big deal.
Not you. I own your ass. The real question is,
where are you with Emily?
Absolutely.
Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved
you doing magic and me doing this.
No, you didn't.
Well, it doesn't matter now, because I love how things
worked out.
Made up my mind to date both of them by
pretending to be twin brothers.
You're right. It could totally happen.
You still have a girlfriend.
Are you gonna tell Emily?
Don't make it too hot.
Look at that, you shaved it all.
Ew, really? Get it out.
Uh, wish we had a skimmer.
I don't know how to turn off the jets.
I'm gonna put this down your robe. It's not moving,
but I think it's still alive.
No. No, and it's not a rat, it's a rabbit.
We need to save it.
Um, I don't know, look it up on your phone.
I'm gonna wrap it in a towel.
Anything else?
He's eating. That's a good sign.
He's pretty cute.
It is Valentine's Day. How about Valentino?
Are you okay?
Oh. Well, why did you put your finger near its
mouth?
He's so little. I'm sure it's fine.
Oh, terrific.
If you're really worried, we'll take him to the vet
and have him tested.
Oh, cut off his head? That's where his little nose
is.
Howie, this is just your hypochondria.
We'll find another time to tell him I'm pregnant.
Morning.
I don't know. Maybe it says something on the back.
What could it be? We are Groot? We are the
champions? We are family? I got all my sisters with
me?
Yeah.
Pretty positive. That's a joke, because the pregnancy test says…
I know, it's crazy.
Oh, it's okay, you'll figure it out.
I don't know, Howie.
Calm down, it's gonna be okay.
So, I'm glad you guys are here. There's something I
want to share with you. Howie and I are going
to…
I'm pregnant.
Yeah, it's all real exciting.
I am. Of-of course I am. I'm, I'm sure it's
just the hormones. But it's weird, Howie's the one who's
been talking about having kids for years, and I was
all excited to tell him because I thought he'd be
thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now
this feels like a bad idea and I'm gonna get
fat.
Easy for you to say, skinny bitch. Sorry, hormones.
You're probably right. After we talked about it, he started
to calm down.
Where?
Can't drink.
Doctor said I can't have sushi.
Doctor said I can't go in the hot tub.
I kind of already do that for Howie.
Well, we didn't exactly decide. We were talking about it,
and then one night we got a little reckless.
No, I'm embarrassed.
Fine. We were out one night, and things got a
little spontaneous.
Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones
and railroad schedules, and I went out…
Kind of on Sheldon's bed.
I was headed to the bathroom, and I passed Howie
on his way out. Usually he says, do not go
in there, but this time he said, hey, let's go
in here.
I'm sorry, but you know what it's like when you're
with your man and one thing leads to another.
You guys can go in if you want.
That sounds fun.
How is that a drunk text?
Sure.
It's okay to be nervous. I am, too.
Me, too.
I appreciate this, but you really…
What kind of cake do you like?
No, no, no. Come on in.
Doing great.
Yeah.
Happy birthday!
I can't think of anything to say that hasn't already
been said, so, here's to you, Sheldon.
Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday,
dear Sheldon, Happy birthday to you.
A little. And it doesn't help that I've got this
heightened sense of smell.
Yeah. The other day I sniffed out where Howie hid
the Girl Scout cookies. No more Tagalongs, my ass.
That's nice.
You don't think she'd actually send you something gross or
dangerous, do you?
Although I am getting a little machine oil. I think
it's metal.
What is that?
I wonder how much she spent on this.
Damn. All I got for Valentine's Day was a postcard
saying my Vermont Teddy Bear was back-ordered.
Or she's telling the truth and just being nice.
Well, if you change your mind, we'll be here.
I'm a little tired, Howie. You ready to go?
What is it?
So, you're just gonna sign this without having a lawyer
look at it?
I know, but…
Well, I should hope so. The whole thing was your
idea.
If you want to sign a contract that Sheldon whipped
up, go ahead.
Sure.
I just want to make sure you've thought this through.
Howie, you're about to form a legal partnership with Sheldon
Cooper.
I'm not worried about you. I'm worried about me. I
don't want to go through this pregnancy listening to you
complain about Sheldon driving you crazy more than you already
do.
You've tried to work with him before. It hasn't gone
well. Why is this time gonna be any different?
Are you saying that his contributions aren't as valuable as
yours?
How would you enforce it?
25% of profits due to Sheldon Cooper will be allocated
to a scholarship fund for the firstborn child of Howard
and Bernadette Wolowitz. Sheldon, that's so nice.
We heard there were some sexy scientists working hard all
weekend.
Can we really help?
Sometimes he solders at home with his shirt off. It's
like a beer commercial.
I'm kind of getting into the groove here.
It is crazy. It's also crazy that I've made fourteen
of these and you've made three.
Since when do you work on weekends?
Not with Lightning McQueen here.
I feel bad. Should we have asked him to stay?
What's going on?
Son of a bitch.
Yeah, let's see how deep a hole they can dig
for themselves.
Okay. Okay, how about this? They don't know you're here
with us, so you hide in the closet. When they
show up, we'll hear whatever their dumb story is about
where they were, we'll pretend to believe them and just
when they think they got away with it, you jump
out.
Go hide.
Oh. Well, thank you for being honest.
It's okay. They apologized.
Should we invite Raj?
Come on, Raj, give me a bag.
Uh, Raj took me to the baby doctor and then
we swung by the grocery store.
Yes and yes.
I didn't, but Raj volunteered.
Yeah, ever since you told him I was pregnant, he's
really been making a fuss over me.
Raj found all these childbirth videos online. This one is
of a woman giving birth in a river.
I don't think so. He just wants to be part
of the experience.
Oh, it's an ultrasonic microphone so we can hear the
baby's heartbeat.
Actually, Raj ordered it. He made me promise to wait
till he was here.
Yeah.
It's a sore spot, don't bring it up.
Leave it alone. He means well.
No, not really.
He's just trying to be supportive.
No.
You saw him carrying that.
And, of course, Howie and I both want you to
be a part of all this.
Raj, Raj, wait.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can't tell anymore.
And bring back the bear.
I hear that.
Of course.
I'm not hearing anything.
Wait, that's it.
Isn't that the best?
Hey, Raj.
Good. A little tired.
You guys have fun. I'm just gonna snuggle up in
bed with a book.
He's gonna be okay.
Why are you dressed like that?
That wasn't nice.
You all right?
It's okay, you should go.
Of course.
Me? How? Why?
Gee, Sheldon, I don't know.
I guess we could give it a try.
I brought sparkling cider.
So what do you want to do tonight?
There's more than one?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, I have to ask.
What is it about trains that you like so much?
That's lovely, Sheldon.
Dungeons & Dragons? That sounds about right.
Okay, but just for a little bit.
All right.
You bet.
Oh. I like the idea of being tall.
This is getting fun. What's next?
Oh, I haven't had a drink in months.
I storm in, slam my sword down, and say, barkeep,
bring me the strongest ale you have and serve it
in the skull of a goblin.
Does it have eyes?
I stab it in the middle eye.
Okay, I guess I should eat the Hell Prawn.
Wow, this night turned out to be so much more
fun than I thought.
Thank you for this. You know, ever since people found
out I'm having a baby, I feel like I became
Pregnant Bernadette. It was nice to take a little break
tonight.
Well, thanks again.
I might just take you up on that.
Amy's with Sheldon who she loves like a son. You're
with her son, who she doesn't.
So, Beverly, did you know Penny is the number three
sales rep at our pharmaceutical company?
Well, we don't exactly. I'm a microbiologist for the research
team.
Some exciting new anti-anxiety drugs.
Well, let's get back to Penny. Hey, weren't you telling
me something great about your company car?
Do I think he'd be interested? Sometimes I hear him
pretending to be interviewed when he's alone in the bathroom.
Um, you should probably talk to Penny, too.
But we did get to see a live stream of
it on the Internet.
Howie? You doing okay? You've been in there a while.
Who's going to officiate?
Who's Erno Rubik?
Well, it's very sweet of you to go to all
this trouble for Leonard's mother.
Come on, Howard, you're overreacting.
You do realize those weren't documentaries, right?
Guys, come on. We're meeting everyone for dinner.
Are you done with this nonsense?
Oh, stop. You know what's really happening? All the movies
you've watched, the TV shows, the comic books, they've completely
twisted your thinking. No one's after you, no one's listening
to you, no one cares about you.
You're being ridiculous.
It's probably just a coincidence. Speed up a little, see
if he stays with you.
Do not pull over. I'm not raising this baby alone.
Hey, Penny. What are you talking about? Oh, that was
you? Long story. Why don't you go ahead and eat.
We're gonna be a while.
