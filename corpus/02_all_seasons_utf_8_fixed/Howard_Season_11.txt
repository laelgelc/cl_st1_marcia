Well, congratulations. I'm so happy for you two. Hold on,
I have to tell Bernadette. Hey, Bernie, guess what? Sheldon
and Amy got engaged. Can you believe it?
She's so happy... I think she's crying.
Look at Nowitzki over there.
Because you're sticking up for Sheldon, or because you're still
mad she rejected you?
Hey. Want me to make dinner?
Ooh, if it's how to make dinner, that'd be great.
Is this a... pregnancy test?
That means... positive?
No.
No.
No! How could this even happen? Uh, w-- we were
careful.
No!
No! No! No!
Okay! Okay! Okay! Well, w-what are we gonna do?
No!
No!
I'm trying!
You really think so?
Some suggestion of make-up sex that did not go over
well, even though it's not like we can get more
pregnant.
And we already have one.
No, that's a great idea, we could go through it
together. Wouldn't that be fun?
Come on, it'd be so cute, our kids playing together?
What do you say, why don't you two hit the
old mattress and whip up a family?
Hey.
Uh... Could be.
Okay, let's talk about something that won't infuriate my pregnant
wife.
Try again.
Oh, cool. How come?
Yeah, this is public radio. Doesn't he realize that dozens
of people might hear him?
There's Leonard. I'll bet he's having a rough day.
You might not want to mention that to Lady Fiance.
No, let 'em go. If we get lucky, maybe one
of them will start crying.
Fine.
We're here. What's going on?
"Cheer them up"? Do you even know what a scientist
is?
Oh. Oh, my God, I'm gonna have two babies.
I don't know. Popular?
I know where we need to go.
We're going to see Richard Feynman.
Yep. Most people don't know he's actually buried right here
in Altadena.
Well. Here he is.
This guy knew how to live. He taught himself musical
instruments. He studied Portuguese. Just to give a speech in
Brazil.
Give me the bottle. I mean, it might be a
little corny, but I say we pour one out for
all the science homies who came before us.
Mm-hmm.
It's a date-- just pick one.
Oh. Great. Just a reminder-- you're pregnant.
Oh. Just a reminder-- you're married.
Is she single?
What about Stuart?
Okay. Well, it's just... we have two single friends.
That's all I ask.
This picture of Galactus eating a planet looks like my
preggo wife destroying a coffee cake.
It feels like it wasn't that long ago we were
here doing this for Halley.
Yeah.
You know, for the first one, we really wanted a
girl, but this time around, we don't have a preference.
Oh.
Hey, I barely know how to be a man myself.
Now I have to teach someone?
Now I'm having a son? I'll have to teach him
how to play sports, and-and watch sports and-and-and-and-and-and...
I don't know if I can teach that. It's just
something I was born with.
That's true. You know, as a kid, I used to
make model rockets. That'd be pretty cool to do with
a son.
I haven't looked at all this stuff in years.
Yeah. My dad bought it before he, you know, abandoned
our family.
Could never bring myself to open it without him. It's
silly.
You know what? Forget the past. What do you say
you and me build this rocket?
Right?
Oh. I should've brought peanuts.
I'm not gonna eat them. It's a thing they do
at JPL. When the Ranger mission finally had a successful
launch, there were peanuts in the room. Ever since then,
they have them at every launch.
It's more of a tradition.
I don't think that's a real thing.
I-I don't think we can get peanuts out here.
Now that I think about it, maybe it is more
of a superstition.
All right. Here we go. L-minus ten, nine...
I was an astronaut. We used L-minus.
It's my rocket! We're doing it my way.
L-minus ten, nine, eight, seven, six...
...five, four, three, two, one...
Well, that's perfect. I mean, the one thing I thought
I could do with my son, I can't even do
that right.
I was being sarcastic.
Sheldon, what am I gonna do? I mean, what do
I know about raising a boy?
Oh, my God, you're right.
Thanks for trying, but you're not gonna be able to
cheer me up.
What?
Did it help?
Let's get going.
I don't know, maybe.
What about people distracted by irritating passengers?
Strongly disagree.
No. You can't drive. You don't even have a license.
Really? Since when?
You really want to drive?
Live, Sheldon. I want to live.
Your hands are at 10
You're doing great.
Thanks.
Go for it, champ.
Sorry. Just ease on the gas, and...
Oh, too much! Too much!
No, it's not! Slow down!
No.
There's a time and place for your randy dog stories,
and... it's never and nowhere.
Oh, well, have you thought about adding a phased array
of sensors for better localization?
She was talking about me, Sheldon. I'm perfectly qualified.
Are you kidding? If I could control robot arms with
my brain, I'd be able to do so many things.
Amy, your lab is amazing. A C-arm fluoroscope, a cranial
ultrasound... And look at that coffee maker.
So this is it?
Based on that ring on your finger, I'd say you're
pretty good at controlling robots.
If we add phase detection to your EEG sensors, I'll
have to rewrite most of the code.
Well, these hands were made to do three things
I do. And if you have something to say, you
can say it to my face.
I'm a little rusty. Could you say that again?
Okay, I'm gonna extend the wait time and have it
poll the A-to-D converter at the top of the loop
instead of the bottom.
You think that's impressive, take apart that brain model.
I used to make it appear in my pants, but
HR said I had to stop doing that.
Well, it needs to compile, so it's gonna be a
few minutes.
You want to hear some Neil Sedaka?
I love, I love, I love my calendar girl. Yeah,
sweet calendar girl. I love, I love, I love my
calendar girl. Each and every day of the year. January
You start the year all fine...
Hey.
We're just waiting for my code to compile. What are
you doing here?
Well, I-I'd love to, but we're just about to test
the interface. It could take a while. RAJ
You know, once we get this operational, we could probably
figure out how to make it wireless.
Or we could brew a pot of coffee and power
through.
Why don't you ask your skeleton?
I can't. I'm not allowed to eat for 12 hours
before my surgery, and I only got two more minutes.
And I'm done.
He did. He was cremated, and his remains were put
in a baking soda volcano.
She's not a scientist.
Gift shop.
So was having sex, and look where that got us.
When you were in labor and I said that, you
kicked me.
No. I'll be fine.
Sit down! Wish me luck.
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
You know nothing about Jewish people.
You know what? It hurts so much, go ahead.
Bernie?
App store.
You want to lie down, watch a movie?
You-you sure you're not overdoing it?
Great. Then maybe, instead of Chinese, fire up the grill
and throw on a couple of steaks? Kung pao chicken,
please.
Hey. How was the doctor?
Don't say twins. Don't say twins. Don't say twins. Don't
say twins.
Oh. I mean, because I would have loved them both.
Oh, no. It may not look like it, but I'm
running to you!
Yeah, hanging out in bed with my wife, thawing out
some frozen peas in my pants-- living the dream.
Oh, I'll get her.
No, he had to work. Plus, he has a quota
for the amount of Indian servant jokes he can tolerate,
and, apparently, I filled it.
Never better.
He does love the bus.
No. No!
So I-I guess... no.
It would be a big help.
This is actually kind of nice, you and me getting
to spend a couple days in bed together.
I'm glad my balls hurt. It's all their fault.
Definitely. Probably.
I'm getting a little hungry.
That'd be great.
And now you also get to see an annoyed blonde
walk into the room.
What are you talking about?
Yeah. You were a terrible waitress, and we still asked
you to get us a snack.
I don't know about you, but I am not eating
whatever she brings us.
Well, she never really liked me. It's kind of nice
she hates you now, too.
Sounds fun.
That sound you hear, ironically, crickets.
Does sound better than cricket.
Also something I would watch instead of cricket.
I don't get how you can enjoy cricket. It makes
no sense.
Yeah. That's the sport of my people.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, save some syllables for the rest
of us. Hey, I think that's Bernadette's friend over there.
Let's see if you can go two for two.
Hi.
Tell me about it. I had to drag this guy.
Oh, that clears that up.
Speaking of googlies, I'm gonna go.
Look, while Bernadette's on bed rest, we're gonna have to
divide and conquer. I've got one monitor for her, one
for the baby. Which do you want?
You're kidding. You slept with her?
Well, at least the romance is still alive.
She lies around all day eating Mallomars and hollering at
me, so her transformation from my wife to my mother
is complete.
Are you guys working together on that meteorite project?
I know. Sometimes when you're dating, you meet weird people.
I once met a girl who didn't like juggling.
Right, so you'll only be in a physical one?
Someone who is just interested in sex?
Whoa, hold on. Give him a chance. He's gonna get
this.
So how was your night with Ruchi? Oh, great. We
ordered in some food, we had sex, I left. I
didn't even ask if she enjoyed it.
I can field that one for her.
Again, I know.
Before Sheldon gets here? Last time we did that, he
didn't talk to us for a month. So do it!
Hey, hey. I got a big surprise for you.
Wow, did I oversell it. It's Raj and Ruchi!
Okay, wasn't sure how long I should let you guys
stay. Now I know! Get out!
Oh, come on, he means well. He's just trying to
impress his girlfriend.
I'm only saying this because I love you and because
you can't reach me from that bed, but you sound
a little crazy.
I don't believe you. Why would the military want Sheldon?
Well, he better not be working on our guidance system.
That was my idea.
Great. I want answers and he'd better give them to
us.
Hi, sir. Um, Leonard has a question.
Is he working on our guidance system or not?
Well, who said he was team leader?
Yeah, so we were just waiting for you to tell
us who you thought-- Okay, I hear it.
He told us everything.
Sheldon went to the Air Force behind our backs.
But y-your communication system was based on our guidance system.
No, he's right. You are a bully, a credit hog
and a self-promoter. And if anyone around here is like
Tesla, it's us.
You know, that guidance system was my idea. You figured
out how to make it work. We didn't even need
Sheldon.
Hey, we're bagging on Sheldon here! Focus! I guess it
was pretty smart using our quantum technology as the basis
for a communication system.
Ooh. So instead of having to keep it at negative
271 degrees, you'd only have to keep it at negative
108. It would be way more efficient.
You're an idiot! We don't tell Sheldon. We go to
the military behind his back and we screw him like
he screwed us.
Do you think you can do the math?
So what do you think? Can you make it work?
Yeah, Leonard thought of it. It's genius.
Good God, man, shut up!
Why limit ourselves to the U.S. military? I bet there's
a lot of other places we could take this.
You know, it's easy to shoot an idea down, Leonard.
That's impossible. We haven't even pitched it yet.
Damn it!
Did you screw us over?
Can't believe we let Kripke use us like that.
You may have a point about her social skills.
I remember. That was not a lot of clothes.
Hey.
Yeah, I can't believe a single Bitcoin is worth about
$5,000 now.
Oh, yeah, I remember that.
It's not that surprising. They were basically worthless when we
got them.
Yes, Ma, I'll be home for dinner. No, I'm not
ruining my appetite with candy. Oh, we're having brisket? Be
home at 6:00.
Oh, make your jokes, but my date started a savings
account for me. Did yours?
Really? You're dating Penny, and you're gonna poke at something
that could vanish tomorrow?
So let me get this straight. We have to write
an elaborate program in order to find a fake coin
that we can't spend on anything?
That sounds fun.
Your mom called my mom and said we were being
mean?
Okay, this is the laptop I was using in 2010.
The Bitcoin must be on here.
Oh, that depends on whether I tell Bernadette or not.
I know. I was joking. I'm gonna put it in
a college fund. All right, all booted up.
Science! A lot of science.
Okay, the program is almost ready to run.
No, we're not roughhousing! We're scientists! Scientists don't roughhouse!
Mostly Asian. Some oldies.
They're not my little friends, and we don't want cookies!
All right, we'll have cookies! Thank you very much!
Hey, Bernie, you mind if I run to Leonard's and...
If you know, just tell us.
Fine.
You don't have to whisper, you can just nod your
head.
Maybe a kidney. You already have his testicles. You can
start a collection.
Yes!
Why?!
No, no. This might've been during the Comic-Con Dump-A-Thon.
Hand it here.
Okay, here's the Bitcoin folder.
It's empty.
Do you think Zack stole it?
If you want to watch him sweat, walk up a
flight of stairs with him.
Hey, is that Raj there at girls' night?
Just remember, if you fall asleep first, they're gonna freeze
your bra.
You and Amy having fun planning your wedding?
Hello.
Oh, good. Raj is here to tell us today's specials.
Oh. If it doesn't work out, you're ready to go
on your Mormon mission.
But if it did, you could bury me at the
funeral home you direct.
Yeah.
Want to grab some lunch?
Well, let me guess. You're not eating because the mean
girls circled your chubby bits in marker?
Oh, those are just jokes. It's my way of saying
that we're friends, and it wouldn't hurt you to drop
a few!
Come on. You can't blame that on me.
Uh, what are you saying?
Look, I... I can see you're upset, but... I'm gonna
need some ground rules. I mean, while we're apart, can
I see other needy Indian men?
I forget, which mental hospital are you guys registered at?
Hello.
Really? You're not gonna sit here?
You're still on this? I said sorry.
Well, what's it gonna take? You want half my sandwich?
Raj is trying to blame me for his pathetic life.
Hey.
I could ask you the same question.
Sorry. I'm just in a bad mood.
I had a falling out with Raj. He said I
make fun of him too much and it's wrecked his
confidence.
Yeah. I mean, your life's a mess. I don't see
you blaming other people for it.
Maybe I'll just hang out here for a while.
No, that's okay.
Hiding out. I wasn't sure if I was welcome.
Okay.
I think I'm just gonna go.
Why are you smoking meat?
Wow, well, that's actually really sweet.
Yeah, but we're not doing anything big because she's one,
Bernadette's on bed rest, and I'm lazy.
Raj.
I'm willing to make up, but someone's being a baby.
You're a grown man. Act like it.
Hey, werewolf Jughead is not your dad's Jughead.
Hey, guys, there's a change of plans. We are having
a party for Halley's birthday after all. Turns out Bernadette
and "anyone who's not a heartless monster" thinks that's the
right thing to do.
I don't know.
Here you go. Here you go. See you two there.
Or-- hear me out on this-- it doesn't.
Hey, Stuart, you're coming to Halley's party, right?
Great. Can you bring a few things?
Balloons, streamers, ice, snacks, a bounce house, face painter, and
a couple kids whose parents are willing to lie and
say they know me from the Daddy and Me class
I've never been to.
The important thing is we're together, and if the movie
gets too violent, I cover her eyes.
Look, I'm sorry about not inviting you to Halley's birthday.
That wasn't cool. And of course we would love to
have you. Here.
Great, because it's tomorrow, and I need you to plan
it.
Stuart was gonna help, but the free clinic had an
open spot for a colonoscopy, and he jumped on it.
Yes, and I think it's pretty mature of me to
admit it.
Right again. Are you gonna help me or not?
Sh-She's a human being, not an animal. But that actually
would be a hit.
I can't believe you pulled this all together overnight.
You really saved the day.
And I'm sure she'd appreciate it, if she knew what's
going on or who you are.
Okay. Thanks for letting me know.
Bernadette's sister's kids are sick and they're not coming.
Good! Great! Our friends should be here any second!
Oh, grow up.
Well, this party's a disaster.
Is that Wonder Woman?
Then I take it back; it's a great party.
What are you doing?
You're supposed to take your shoes off before you go
in there! You know what? I'm stressed about my daughter's
birthday party. I don't need your attitude.
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you. Thank you for blaming me
for everything that's wrong in your life! Thank you for
walking out on our friendship!
Thank you for making it so easy!
Because you're my best friend and you hurt my feelings!
I can't believe you shoved me!
But it was kind of fun, wasn't it?!
Gladly!
Oh, oh, that was awesome!
One, two, three.
You made it.
Be right up!
Me, too, but life does find a way!
How did you know we did?
Oh, a little. Two months of bed rest-- it's kind
of rough.
She's actually been keeping herself busy doing wedding research for
you.
She wants to. After all, you were her maid of
honor.
Uh-oh. They gave us plain rice instead of fried rice.
You know what? I'll take care of it. This is
Howard Wolowitz. We didn t get our fried rice. My
fat Indian friend is upset. Done.
Please. I've been sending food back my entire life. One
of my first full sentences was, "I had breast milk
for breakfast"
Oh, hey. I didn't know you were here. What are
you two talking about?
I don't know, Sheldon, it's pretty expensive.
Really, a walking clump of swamp grass?
Yeah. Is it just me or have they been acting
strange?
I got one, too.
I did.
You're still working on Sheldon's dumb brain teaser?
No argument here.
Picking a best man isn't about keeping score.
So, bottom line, what you did was wrong and cruel,
which the mother of my children finds oddly appealing.
Too late. Bernade...
Well, I thought Halley was gonna be the flower girl.
Actually, I haven't had the courage to tell her.
I don't know. I think we should start with something
that gets them up on their feet. Maybe "Sherlock Around
the Clock."
Oh. Right. Sorry.
Holmes said to Watson On Baker Street Come on, Doctor
Time to move them feet Sing it with us. Sherlock,
Sherlock Sherlock around the clock
Sherlock, Sherlock, Sherlock around the clock
Sorry. Sorry. I'll get her. One sec.
Be right back. Rock and roll!
Hey.
Oh, shoot. I promised I would take Halley over to
Bernadette's parents.
I know. I'm sorry. I really want to do this,
but I just don't think I have the time.
I don't want to be the one who breaks up
the band. You know, maybe you should... think about replacing
me.
I mean, I know it'll be hard since we...
I-I don't think he did.
I was trying not to wake you.
Sorry. I just realized, now that I'm not in the
band, I can focus on my own music. You know?
Go solo.
Yes, and write an astronaut musical. Picture this. The curtain
opens. There's a lone astronaut floating in the inky blackness
of space. Maybe wires, maybe fog. I'll let the director
figure that out. I really don't know when I'll run
out of oxy... gen.
Good news! I'm back in the band!
It was her idea!
What up, my Hebrews and She-brews?! We are Footprints on
the Moon.
This first song is about the greatest boulder in the
history of cinema. One, two, three. Alone in my temple
in the middle of Peru A giant stone ball with
nothing to do
Because I'm six tons of granite And micaceous schist Yeah,
I'm six tons of granite And micaceous schist
Because I'm six tons of granite And micaceous schist Yeah,
I'm six tons of granite And micaceous schist
I believe... you're right.
Look at this cute picture of Halley in the bath.
Want me to send it to you?
What is that?
What are we looking at here?
So, state's exhibit "A"?
Says the guy in my bed with my wife.
Maybe those are his "after the holiday" pants, like you
have.
Oh, well, I don't even want to think...
What?
First of all, you already look amazing.
I-I think that one was too long.
Please, God, no.
Really? You're not sure which one of us is Rajesh
Koothrappali?
I should go, right?
Okay, I'll call you later.
You did pie halfsies with another man?
Yeah.
For the record, I'm the one who introduced you to
House of Pies.
Hey, Professor Proton.
No problem. I'm on my "launch" break.
Oh, gluino. That's exciting.
I heard you. The first time.
You should talk to Bernadette. Since she's been on bed
rest, she's binged, like, every detective show in the world.
Hey.
I'll take it.
Don't care. Clean slate. Happy Yom Kippur to me.
Do you?
I hope your book has a twist as surprising as
that.
Sheldon, if you want to be on the show, you're
gonna have to apologize to Wil.
I'm so sorry.
He's trying to say he's sorry.
I said "sorry."
Who died and made you detective?
You say we're all suspects. How do we know you're
not the killer?
First of all, it's not sometimes, it's always.
And third, it's not news, it's well-established.
No, of course not, because we don't want to hear
you complain about how much you hate the sound of
crunching eggshells.
Sure.
Wear a baseball cap backwards to prove your point?
He's losing a lot of blood.
We got to find some bandages.
We got to find some bandages.
Oh. Did your water break?
Are you feeling any contractions?
Wait. Well, where are you going?
Honey, babies don't always come on their due date. Halley
was two weeks late. But this baby's a boy. They
don't take as long to get ready.
I'm making the situation better with humor.
Would you rather me make it better with magic?
Ta-da!
Anything for my family.
Yeah. How do you know that?
And why do you know that?
Oh, I don't know. We went to the doctor this
morning, and she said it could still be another week
or two.
It's pretty rough. She's having a hard time.
I had sex twice last night.
It was her idea. She read that it can start
labor.
Well, I would have Googled it, but I was busy
taking my pants off.
Hey.
Oh, sorry. I was gonna do it last night, but
I got kind of busy.
Looks like I might have a little more time before
the baby gets here, so why don't we just stay
late and get it done?
Are there any engineers on the grant committee?
I didn't have time to figure out the three-input hydraulic
manifold, so this diagram is really just a flux capacitor
from Back to the Future.
Hey, I just wish I could be there when you
present it.
Who's Michael?
No, it's not. My son doesn't have a name yet.
I can't believe her. She knows I don't want to
name the baby after her dad.
I don't know. We were gonna wait until we saw
what he looked like.
Michael? Really, you think we're naming him Michael?
I can't believe you're trying to hijack our son's name.
Bernie?
So you're just gonna name him Michael? Were you even
gonna tell me?
When?
I don't want to name our son after your father.
He is? Eventually. I mean, you see the way the
man eats.
Okay, is this the hormones, or have you always been
a lunatic?
Bernie, this is our kid's name. I think we should
both agree.
Thank you.
Exactly. Fifty-fifty.
Harry, like Potter or Houdini.
Okay. How 'bout Al or Max or... Ted or Kevin?
I don't know. Sounds a little too uncircumcised.
I didn't take her. She chaperoned. We slow-danced once.
Paul. Paul Wolowitz. I like it.
Like what, Walla Walla Wolowitz?
You okay?
Is it time? Do we need to go to the
hospital?
Did you have another contraction?
Yep, it's time.
Uh, actually, could you stay here and watch Halley? That
way we don't have to wait for Bernadette's parents.
How you feeling?
Me, too. I thought I'd be super freaked out. But
I'm ready for this. Well, not the part where you're
in labor and you squeeze my fingers till they turn
blue.
It is. I mean, last time, I... Okay, I see
what you're doing.
Just breathe.
That's okay.
Forget about it. Please.
You're right. This kid is part you and part me.
If he cracks five-foot-six, it'll be a miracle.
Aw. Well, I think so, too.
Hey!
Yeah! The baby was born about an hour ago.
The only way I would see my son for the
first time and immediately think "I need to call Raj"
is if he came out brown.
Neil Michael. Neil for Armstrong, Gaiman, and Diamond. Michael because
Bernie had to get six stitches.
I'm not gonna fight her. That kid's head was the
size of a cantaloupe.
A-All done. You know, fun fact, did you know baby
boys can pee straight up?
But you handled it well.
You guys, too.
Michael's out.
Oh, my God, he's so cute.
Switch?
So is she.
Me, too. My heart feels like it's gonna explode. Of
course, it's full of brisket, so it probably will. Oh,
I didn't even know I was capable of loving someone
so much.
Wha-- oh, uh... I'm just messing with you. I totally
love them more than you.
I get that. I would take a bullet for them.
But I would get seriously mutilated for you.
You'd be crazy not to. Even unmutilated, I'm no prize.
Oh, tiring, but super rewarding.
Honestly, it's gonna be hard when we both go back
to work. I've been thinking maybe it would be better
if one of us decided to stay home.
I literally can't tell if you think that's good or
bad.
Here's my dilemma
I don't know. She's really invested in her career, and
she's doing great. I think it should be me.
Didn't you see Taylor Swift twice this month?
Oh, good, you're here. There's... something I want to talk
to you about.
No, this is important. Uh, I was thinking maybe one
of us should stay home full-time, with the kids.
Actually, I was thinking I should stay home.
You just said you didn't want to.
Do you want to?
What if I also want to?
Don't you think you should go back to work, because
you make more money?
I think it's pretty sexist of you to say a
dad can't stay home with his children.
Morning.
Oh, nowhere special. Just the park, the farmer's market, then
we hopped on the Gold Line to Chinatown because it's
important for the kids to experience other cultures. What have
you been doing?
Oh. So are the kids. I guess they take after
you.
You're pretty sharp having just woken up.
Not true. I got this. You know, in fact, why
don't you take the day off?
Take your time. Get a massage. You deserve it after
all the sleep you've been getting.
Oh, boy. I really passed out hard.
I'm sorry. Why did I think I could do this
on my own?
Thanks for covering for me.
What time is it?
Great, then you make dinner.
Oh. I needed some help so he came by, played
with the kids, read them some stories, put them down
for their nap and made dinner.
Ate dinner. Okay, look, I don't think I'm cut out
to be a stay-at-home dad. And since you want to,
you should stay home.
You don't want to stay home, either. Do you?
Well, I love the kids, but I also love my
job. And sleep.
I took a three-hour nap on the floor in the
living room.
Honestly? Still tired.
I love you.
Yeah. Everyone's asleep. You want to head upstairs and... you
know.
Oh, oh, I like the way you think.
The Bat-Signal isn't just to alert Batman, it's also to
strike fear in the hearts of his enemies and let
them know he's coming.
Has that been in the comics?
Sorry, Leonard, you and Penny had a good run.
Why is your screen name "JohnWilliams"?
Do you think you could get Bill Gates to sign
something for me?
Oh, my arm, my chest, his call.
What are we waiting here for?
Same as Bill Gates, try to make the world a
better place, but I'd do it in a working Iron
Man suit.
What are you talking about?
We're not doing anything wrong. We're just hanging out in
a hotel lobby. Plenty of people do that
Guys, guys, that's him. Be cool.
Cooler.
Wow. Hop on Pop took a dark turn there at
the end.
To be fair, I cowrote "Pinky Toe, Pinky Toe."
Well, that's great.
Like Bob the Builder in that giraffe cage.
So that's fun. You get to meet Bill Gates again.
Maybe he won't remember you.
What's going on?
Yeah, why would you do that? You know he's staying
at the DoubleTree in Long Beach.
We probably are.
Hey, that's sexist.
Hey.
And we can all hear your complaining, so no one's
happy.
All right, that smells too good. I got to get
one of those.
If you weren't wearing one of my swimsuits.
You know the rule-- once it touches hiney, it's no
longer miney.
Well, I'm relaxed enough.
Huh. Looks like someone's drone.
One of the propellers is broken. It must have crashed.
Maybe. Should we try and track down the owner first?
Anyone lose a drone? Looks like it's ours.
Shh.
Okay, that ought to do it. I've replaced the propeller
and reattached the gimbal controller unit.
I just need to see if I can re-sync the
controls to this old remote.
The drone, or your stupid robot show?
I got it working!
You read my mind.
Either breaking a bowl or breaking Raj's head.
Yeah. We found it in the yard and fixed it
up.
We asked around, and no one claimed it. Ha. I
think we've done all we can do.
What a great idea, honey.
Okay. All hooked up. Here we go.
Hold on. Now I'm getting a picture.
Do you see anything that could help us locate her?
She's got eagle eyes, always spotting continuity errors in movies.
It's not annoying at all.
Oh. Fine. Zooming in.
She's wearing a pin from your store. Do you know
who she is?
But this time...
Now, I don't use the word "ghoulish" a lot, but...
I-I just can't think of another word.
You think you've got a shot? What if she's married?
Can't believe you got her number.
Well, do us both a favor and start the story
later.
Why do you care?
You really need a girlfriend.
Yeah, he was driven mad by a friend who kept
wanting to talk about the Hulk's car insurance!
His cabin?
Hey, Penny, that's what you sound like when you read.
That's great, everyone's got weekend plans. Amy has her bachelorette
party, and Sheldon's gonna go to the woods and get
hunted for sport.
Fine.
Actually, I...
And now here we are for Sheldon's.
Why?
That's a lot of locks.
The look on your face.
Yeah, what happened to the good old days where if
someone wanted to steal your work, they had to hire
a prostitute to seduce you?
Just making a joke.
I haven't understood anything since poop tomato.
Yeah, I mean, he's a little... kooky, but a mind
that can reconceptualize time probably has a reason for keeping
a jar of toenail clippings that we just don't understand.
Great. Who's gonna tell Amy we lost her fianc to
a madman in the mountains?
And he said he didn't want a wild bachelor party.
And alive?
Uh, April. Most years.
Sure.
Don't think so.
Nothing is wrong with you. You have friends, you have
a fianc e, you have a full life.
What are you doing?
And tonight Mercury is at its highest elongation.
What did he say?
You don't need to, but you probably will.
Is it your teen years?
Are they dancing?
You mean empty and sad?
Why are you being such a baby about the crowds?
You go to Comic-Con.
Wow. We go to Comic-Con for different reasons.
You look great.
Well, it's not a competition, but I wore this suit
to my Bar Mitzvah.
Well, I'll call him.
Stuart, you're supposed to be babysitting.
Well, when can you get here?
Come on. You can't do this to us.
He says he has to work.
But you got all dressed up. We were supposed to
have dinner and romance.
I'm over here, Sheldon.
You doing okay? Do we need to go?
S-Since when?
I talked to her yesterday. She really seems to know
her stuff.
Well, we missed our date night, and Stuart's working again,
so I thought we could have a date night here
at home.
Oh. So... is that really what you're wearing to our
date night?
You might want to hold off on that-- we're starting
with soup.
Wha...? I thought you were working late again.
Oh.
Are you kidding? Stuart's here! Get your purse. We're going
out.
Right. Hey, Stuart! That can of soup sitting by the
stove, that's for you!
And you wore sweatpants. Let's go.
Missed you guys at the faculty mixer.
You're a theoretical physicist. What more do you need than
an office and a whiteboard?
Well, I'm sorry, Sheldon, but this sort of thing happens.
Higgs had to wait almost 50 years before they built
a collider big enough to prove his theory.
If there's someone more relentless than you, I'd like to
meet them.
40 bucks if I can throw a DVD player.
Ooh, did your mom pack your lunch?
How much have you raised? Well, with my Kickstarter campaign,
selling my collectibles, and the money in my bank account,
about $65,000.
You really think so?
Come on, Sheldon. I'll give you a ride out to
the desert right now.
No, we weren't gonna make it to Vegas.
Careful. Don't say his name a third time.
Hey, Bernie. Hey. How do you know if someone has
pink eye?
Okay, thanks. Both kids have pink eye.
I don't have pink eye.
Okay. I'll go back upstairs.
Hey, Raj, remember when you borrowed my VR goggles the
other day?
Yes!
It's not a puzzle, Penny.
Bernadette says they're checking the kids now.
Maybe not. You know, I know it's not traditional wedding
attire, but how about a welder's mask?
Yes.
The one you slept through last weekend.
Come on, you know this one. It's a... dog. I
found him in the backyard. And don't worry, I already
called the owner.
That's probably him.
I'm gonna need a minute. That's Mark Hamill! Hello.
Y-Your dog's name is Bark?
Bark Hamill?
Oh, no, I couldn't take your money. It's just an
honor to meet you.
Oh, you're gonna regret that.
Guess who's gonna officiate Sheldon and Amy's wedding! Mark Hamill!
Luke Skywalker is gonna be at the wedding!
Welcome, Bert. Don't you look nice.
Don't you crack a geode open? It's not a perfect
metaphor.
Yeah.
I found his dog and guilted him into officiating the
wedding. Don't tell Sheldon. It's a surprise.
Yeah, so did he.
I'll let you know. Hey, Wil!
Hey, uh, the bride and groom seem to be running
a little behind. Do you think you could stall?
Hey, everybody! Uh, it's gonna be a few more minutes,
but while we wait, does anyone have any questions about
Star Wars? You got this.
