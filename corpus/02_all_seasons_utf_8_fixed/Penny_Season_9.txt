So, what package are you thinking?
Why would we want that?
Whatever. Put us on the Internet. I’ve always wanted a
wedding with a comment section.
No. No, I want to. Look, we’ve put this off
long enough. Let’s do it.
What’s going on?
She did?
Hey, I just heard about you and Sheldon. Are you
okay?
Uh, actually I’m in Vegas. Leonard and I are about
to get married.
Well, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing.
Amy, don’t be like that.
Okay, will you relax? You’re not missing anything special.
She’s upset. Look, it’s gonna be a great wedding. Look
at you in your little suit.
Okay.
Thanks, but I don’t like glitter on my scrambled eggs.
Me, too.
Yes.
Oh, my God, would you stop bringing it up?
What if they call our names?
Oh, and the fairy tale continues.
Really, we’re good.
Yeah.
I know.
I love you, too.
No, thank you.
No. You wrote vows?
Well, I don’t have any. You’re kind of making me
look bad.
No, no, no, go ahead. I’ll come up with something
mushy, you’ll cry, we got this.
Wow.
Right. Um, okay. Leonard, I mean, you’re not only the
love of my life. I mean, you’re my best friend,
and, you’ve got a friend in me. You got troubles.
I got ’em, too. There isn’t anything I wouldn’t do
for you. We stick together, and we can see it
through, ’cause you’ve got a friend in me.
He loves that movie.
We did it.
Can you?
Okay, let’s do it. You gonna make it?
Nicely done.
Well, the night is still young.
Yeah. I guess.
It’s just, when we were kissing, I couldn’t help but
picture you with that other girl.
You’re right. Just forget it.
Did you feel guilty?
Did you feel guilty after kissing her?
What do you mean, every time you see her?
You still see her?
You work with her? How could you not tell me
that?
Oh, okay. So you’re saying this is my fault?
I thought I was okay, but it turns out I’m
not.
What’s this?
Oh. That’s so sweet of you.
I’m sorry to hear about you and Amy.
You know, it’s bad enough what happened, but then he
tried to hide the fact that he sees her all
the time at the university.
Some girl named Mandy.
Yeah.
That’s great.
That’s ridiculous.
I’m with Leonard.
Right? I can’t believe Amy actually went through with it.
I told her to be true to herself and do
what makes her happy.
Okay, look, it’s not my fault that she thought you
were a bad boyfriend.
Sheldon.
Sure.
Hi.
You couldn’t sleep either?
I don’t know.
Actually, I think he’s onto something.
That’s true. You are.
Hi.
Can we talk?
All right, look, I’m sorry I said I was okay
with everything before we got married. I hate that we’re
going through this, but I don’t know what to do.
Okay, when I’m done with him, I’m gonna need more
information.
Okay, look, I might be overreacting, but how am I
supposed to get past this when I know tomorrow you’re
gonna go to work and see this woman?
Really? Why is that?
No, but now that you’re being weird about it, maybe
I should.
No, I just want to know that when you’re at
work, there’s nothing going on.
Yeah, well, maybe she has interest in you.
I guess my big problem is I never saw Leonard
as the kind of guy who would do something like
this.
What do you think?
You know, I fell in love with Leonard because he
wasn’t anything like the guys I was used to dating.
I mean, I knew those guys weren’t above cheating because
that’s usually how we met.
I want to believe you. I really do. Am I
being naive?
You know, he never would’ve done this when we first
met. He’s cockier now.
I never thought about it like that.
So, you said you had something to tell me.
Uh-huh.
I’m listening.
Okay, that is the lamest excuse you could’ve possibly come
up with. But I get it.
Yeah. Yeah, sometimes I worry you’re gonna wake up and
leave me for someone more like you.
You know what I mean. And, you know, maybe the
way I’ve been reacting was me sabotaging this, too.
That sounds nice.
Oh. Oh, my God, that is the most beautiful thing
anyone’s ever said to me.
It’s getting kind of cheesy, Leonard.
Oh, damn it, you topped it. Should we go to
the bedroom and make this marriage official?
Okay.
Sheldon, I can’t believe you got us a wedding gift.
Oh.
That’s so great.
We?
Oh, no, no, I just, I said, Whee.
Nah, if I want to see a naked dancing man,
I just flush the toilet while Leonard’s in the shower.
Hey.
You really didn’t have to, whoa! That is anatomic.
Oh, that’s Leonard. He said they’re about to cross the
border.
Oh, yeah, right. Lock up your daughters or Sheldon might
lecture them about the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Oh, it’s good. I just wish Leonard would work up
the courage to tell Sheldon he’s moving in here.
We are. I mean, he sleeps here. But it’s only
a matter of time before Sheldon has a bad dream
and tries to climb into bed with the Leonard-shaped pile
of pillows.
Yes.
Yes.
You know, it is normal to want to change your
look after a breakup.
Your glasses?
Your shoes.
Oh.
Okay, well, you’re a grown woman now.
Why? I can do it right here.
No. All you need is a needle and an ice
cube. I’ve done it, like, a dozen times.
Oh, come on. I’ll be gentle. Let me take your
ear virginity.
Uh, no, not yet. There’s still a few people I
haven’t told personally.
Oh, just my parents and my entire family.
Well, I don’t want to hurt my dad. You know,
he always wanted to dance with his daughter at her
wedding.
They started to, then her water broke. You know, if
he finds out we eloped, it’s gonna break his heart.
Well, not necessarily. You know, Dad’s not getting any younger,
so if I wait long enough, I’ll just tell him
he walked me down the aisle and it was magical.
There you go. You’re all done.
I’m starting to see why you and your mom aren’t
very close.
You’re not gonna let this go, are you?
Fine, you want me to call? I’ll call. Why am
I so nervous?
Yeah? How did it go? Did she make you crawl
into the breaking-up drawer?
You’ve been giving me a hard time and you haven’t
even told your mom about Sheldon?
Fine. I’m calling home, but when I’m done, you’re calling
your mother.
Hey, Daddy.
Uh, good. Is Mom around?
Okay, I’ll talk to her later. Uh, Dad, there’s something
I need to tell you. Leonard and I got married.
Last week. I’m sorry, I should’ve told you. It was
a spur of the moment thing. I feel terrible. Please
don’t be too disappointed.
Very. Leonard is so great.
Aw, thank you, Daddy. That means so much.
It is. You’re the best dad ever.
Well, what is it?
No.
Moondance?
You killed my pig?
When?
You didn’t tell me for a year?
Thanks a lot, guys.
Before I made that call, my pig was alive and
happy and rolling around in the mud. Now he’s illegally
buried in our backyard next to my great-grandmother.
No. He was a beloved member of the family.
It’s not funny. You’re up. Call your mother.
Phone, now.
Try dialing.
Okay, just give me that. Amy broke up with Sheldon,
she got her ears pierced and she made us eat
penis cookies. Hang on. She wants to talk to you.
What? What are you doing back?
Oh, I’m sorry.
If it makes you feel any better, I pierced Amy’s
ears and her mom made her sit in my closet.
My dad killed my pig with his tractor.
You win.
Oh, we’re glad you had fun.
Uh, well, honey, you know, now that Leonard and I
are married, it kind of makes sense that we actually
live together.
Sheldon, please, we already feel bad about this.
I’m proud of you. You’re taking this really well.
What’s the matter?
So, what are you thinking for dinner?
Well, honey, you don’t live with Sheldon any more. You
can have anything you want.
How about Thai food?
Hey, we’re going to dinner. You want to come?
Hang on. Wait, you actually think it’s 2003?
Are you doing okay?
Well, come on, he’s a grown man in his 30
s pretending to be a grown man in his 20
s. He’s fine.
What else can you do? Move back in with him?
Well, so do I, but don’t you want to live
with your wife and set the thermostat to whatever you
want and have your body tell you when it’s time
to go to the bathroom, you know, not a schedule
slipped underneath your door every morning?
Trust me, this is the right thing.
They’re not saying that.
No, no, they’re really not.
Okay, you don’t know what’s gonna happen.
Okay, look, we don’t need to rush into anything. All
right? Maybe instead of Leonard moving in with me, we
just leave things the way they are, and sometimes we’ll
sleep over there, and sometimes we’ll sleep over here.
Sure.
Well, it’s not forever. It’s just for a while. If
you want, we can think of him like he’s our
dog.
Yeah, I think it’s great you guys want to get
more exercise, but do you really think sports is the
right choice for you?
Okay, Leonard, sweetheart, you twisted your ankle playing Scrabble.
All right, well, what have you tried so far?
Really? In a comic book store?
Hey, have you read the online reviews for this place?
All right, well, Heather H says, the owner stared at
me the whole time and didn’t blink once. Kelly M
says, the creepy guy who runs it asked me out,
then called himself stupid before I could say no. Jessica
K says, I told the weird owner that I liked
his shirt. He took it off and gave it to
me.
Yeah.
Well, you’re talking to us now. I mean, you don’t
seem nervous.
Okay. Don’t be offended, but, what went wrong with you?
Well, he knew he was on the breast cam.
And sometimes we marry them anyway.
What?
I told you things would change if you plucked your
eyebrows.
Well, what are you gonna do?
I think she means not a weirdo.
All right, well, what happens if you imagine him naked?
Oh, good for him.
So is she, like, homeless, or framing him for a
crime?
Oh, which one? Maybe we can get Amy to try
it.
Oh, and if you lose the game, you have to
go out with Stuart.
Wow. So how many girls have you met?
Well, so how does it work?
Oh, come on, just let him put the app on
your phone.
Okay, let me see. Nope, nope, nope, oh, he’s cute.
And he’s sad about it.
Hey.
Okay, here we go. Now everyone can see. All right.
Where do we stand on cross-eyed Mike?
Okay, okay, okay. Thumbs down. Next.
Well if he’s good in bed, she can throw him
a fish.
Look, it’s Stuart.
Okay, does everyone remember the rules? If he’s shirtless, one
sip. Posing with a pet, two sips. Pet and shirtless,
chug like it’s your job. And pull.
Chug.
Amy, you’re getting a text.
You went on a date last night? Are you seeing
someone?
Amy
I can’t believe you’re seeing someone and we don’t even
know about it.
Amy.
Well, good for you.
In school?
Does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?
Yes. Don’t take your shirt off just because the director
said so.
And I’m laughing like I did the first time I
heard it.
Aw. When he says things like that, I just want
to hug him and make everything better.
Yeah, you probably had it coming.
Hi. Look at that. I’m in a movie, my shirt
stayed on.
Oh, my God. We’ve done things on that couch.
Okay, enough about the napkin. What else you hiding in
there?
I would.
Oh, what’s that ring box?
What?
Okay, back to the ring. Does Amy even know about
this?
I know. It just…
I knew I could smell ’em.
Oh pfft.
I’m sorry. I’m not here.
Um.
All right, fine. Well, Sheldon, I’m no expert, but aren’t
you completely missing the point of Spock? I mean, he
liked to act like he had no emotions, but he
was still half human.
I’m just saying, you pretend you don’t, but you have
feelings just like everybody else.
Sweetie, you’re yelling.
I can’t believe Sheldon was gonna ask Amy to marry
him.
Yeah.
Definitely.
Do you know what that means?
Are you telling the truth?
What are you gonna do?
I think it’s so adorable you’re making Sheldon breakfast.
Aren’t you worried you’re making French toast on oatmeal day?
Oh, I don’t want credit for that.
Oh. Good for you.
And you don’t want to make the same mistake with
the next woman.
Don’t take advice from a man who threw his shoe
at a crow.
Come on, Amy, show us the dress.
Uh, I don’t think any of your comfort zones are
showing.
No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because
my brain just popped out of my shirt.
Ooh.
Yeah, come on, tell us more.
Well, we’re your best friends, give us one more detail
and we promise we’ll leave you alone.
All right, where is tall British Dave taking you?
Good luck. I threw out all my tall ones when
I married Leonard.
We don’t even know what time they’re gonna be there.
Damn, you’re sneaky.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, we’re gonna meet up
with Bernadette to spy on Amy and her date.
What, and you think I want to see a documentary
about aluminium can recycling?
No, it’s the movie your wife doesn’t want you to
see.
You’re not curious who she’s out with?
But you’re curious about aluminium cans? You’re a weird little
guy.
Hey. So, where are they?
Oh, damn it, we should have brought binoculars.
Oh, there he is.
Yeah.
What, now you’re interested? You didn’t even want to come.
Fine.
Your what?
He really seems into her.
I had to; we’re married now.
What? Here, give me, give me. Oh, my God. Oh,
my God, they’re coming right towards us.
Okay. Well, wait, what about Leonard?
Oh, no.
Yeah, Leonard and I are gonna be cooking all day.
But we can’t.
Mm-hmm.
Look at us. Our first Thanksgiving as husband and wife.
Sweetie, you are grown up.
Yep. What’s the code?
It’s not working.
Nope.
Uh.
Yes, I do.
May.
I’m not gonna say your password out loud. That is
not secure.
Well, you don’t know everything about me.
Oh, look at us. Our last Thanksgiving as husband and
wife.
Fine. You think you know so much. Who’s my favourite
Spice Girl?
Who’s my favorite member of NSYNC?
Who’s my favorite Backstreet Boy?
Damn it.
Hang on. Wait, wait. Why don’t I like the lingerie
you got me?
Interesting. I never told you that.
No. I never told anyone that. But I did write
it in my journal.
I also know your voice gets higher when you’re lying.
How can reading my journal be an accident?
Well, when you realized what it was, why didn’t you
stop?
All right. Let’s just finish cooking.
Okay, really, I’m fine.
Oh, God. Stop. I don’t want you to read something
you think’ll just butter me up. I want to hear
the most recent thing you wrote.
Does it really say that?
OMG. OMG. We’re so close to the new Star Wars.
I can’t take it. Gah. Gah?
Hey. Where’d you go? I can’t tell if the turkey’s
done.
What are you doing?
I am not putting that on the Internet. I don’t
want people to see this. I don’t want to see
it.
Oh.
Well, I’ve never been friends with any of my exes.
Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head.
It happens to everybody.
I told you if we were patient, he’d figure it
out for himself.
Public nudity?
Hey, sweetie, why don’t you take a break and do
something else for a while?
Okay, great. What is it?
I’ll pay a thousand dollars to watch you cut footloose.
Oh, my God, he won’t stop.
Nobody knows. That’s why he’s number one. Can you please
go talk to him?
Once? Who got the gum out of his hair?
Fine.
Who cares?
Problem solved.
Come on, Sheldon. There are plenty of smart people who
don’t have mental problems.
Maybe he just had bread in his pocket.
Do you even like the Beach Boys?
Why?
Okay, look, I know Amy’s like an old lady, but
she’s not old enough to have a song from the
sixties written about her.
She did soften your life, didn’t she?
Better. You’re the lint trap of my love.
I’m really happy you and Amy are back together.
Uh, sweetie, you do realize Thursday is Amy’s birthday.
You guys just got back together. You might not want
to ditch her on her birthday.
Aw, that’s nice. Put that on her cake.
Well, find out.
Come in.
We’re sorry. What do you need?
Wow. You can really arrange that?
Sorry. I was waiting for the bazinga.
Okay, well, what’s the third option?
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Let’s, let’s, let’s just recap
our options. All right, we’ve got harp thing, sheep thing.
Sheldon, being physical with Amy is a huge step for
you.
Sheldon, that’s so beautiful.
Well, you’re spending your birthday with Sheldon. Why not celebrate
early?
Sure, sure. Or we could take you to get a
bikini wax.
Uh, I don’t know. It was just a thought.
Oh, we just want you to be prepared for any
surprises that might happen tomorrow.
Yes. He said he wants to do something to show
you how much you mean to him.
I know. Then you’ll finally stop talking about it.
Have fun, guys.
Knowing them, they will.
I don’t know. He said he’s ready.
Well, I’m gonna stay positive. I mean, we talked, I
told him what women like, and after he stopped giggling,
he seemed pretty sure of himself.
Hey.
Oh, not good. Still couldn’t get in to see Dr.
Gallo.
I’m not sick. It’s for work. There’s this doctor who
refuses to see any sales reps. I’ve been trying to
get in for months.
Well, the doctor’s a woman, but yes, because you never
know.
Um, a psychiatrist. Why?
Yeah, they already know I’m a pharmaceutical sales rep.
That’s interesting.
Uh, denial. See, sweetie, the list goes on and on.
I don’t know. You could talk to her, and maybe
if it comes up, you could ask if she’s heard
about the drug.
Thank you.
Hey, how’d it go?
Yeah, no one cares. Did you help me out or
not?
You’re only hearing that because I cannot roll my eyes
any louder.
Really? Oh, you’re the best husband ever.
I guess.
And in double-blind studies, Placinex proved extremely effective in treating
all kinds of anxiety. Actually, funny story, the boys in
the lab were worried about getting FDA approval for Placinex.
They started taking it, stopped worrying.
Uh, do you have any questions?
Mm-hmm?
I just meant a question about the drug.
I don’t wanna.
You know, I used to wear tank tops a lot.
That was a big selling point.
How can I not sound like his mother when our
entire bedroom is filled with Star Wars toys? I mean,
have you ever had sex with a stuffed Wookiee watching
you?
You know, if anything, he’s turning me into his mother.
Before I did pharmaceutical sales, I was an actress. You
know, I was pretty good. You know, girl-next-door type, but
hot. Doable.
And not only am I Leonard’s mother, but we have
this man-child living with us named Sheldon.
Yeah, he’s as real as the fine I get when
I use too much toilet paper.
I do. You know, Leonard’s right. Talking to you is
really helping.
Okay, if you think it’ll help. Oh, just don’t make
it Placinex. I do not need sudden fits of homicidal
rage.
I guess I just miss when life was simpler.
Hey, so I saw a movie trailer the other day.
How could Batman possibly fight Superman? I mean, isn’t that
dumb?
No, no, no, no, no. I’ve seen that movie. It’s
called Iron Man.
And now Ben Affleck is Batman?
Ooh, we should watch that next girls’ night.
Oh, I love me some Leo.
You really don’t know why?
Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast. I made your bed. I
checked your mouth for thrush. You can rub your own
chest.
Oh, that could be fun. But just to be clear,
you mean a party bus with booze and music, right,
not, like, juice boxes and video games?
Well, I’m in. When are we going?
Oh, Sheldon, you don’t even like it there.
Can this wait?
Okay, fine, I accept your apology, now get out.
Leonard.
So, was the fight really bad?
No.
No.
Is she okay?
And there’s your next T-shirt.
Here’s some champagne.
You couldn’t give us just one weekend?
If we drop them off at a fire station, they
have to take them, no questions asked.
And now you see the problem.
Shake it, baby.
Yeah.
What is that?
Ah, yeah, Grandma by Calvin Klein. You know, the last
time I got a hand written letter it was from
someone who told me I parked like a blind person.
I park fine.
Constance, are you sure I can’t pour you some wine?
She could just eat him up.
Yes. I’m a pharmaceutical sales rep.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You go ahead. I’ll catch up with
you.
All right, let’s go.
Wow. You know, the last time I saw my grandma,
the most exciting thing was watching the ash of her
cigarette get longer and wondering if it was gonna fall
in her pudding.
Yeah, right in there. She ate it and everything.
Come in.
Uh-oh.
Hi. Sorry. Sheldon would like to say something to you.
Go ahead.
Say yes.
So, you really gonna break up with her?
Well, I have broken up with my fair share of
guys. I mean, how many times did I break up
with Leonard?
All right, my advice to you is do it at
her place so you can leave when you need to,
uh, tell the truth, make it quick and be prepared
for tears.
No, I, I really didn’t.
An hour? What? That’s crazy. We have a reservation.
So what did you say?
All right, well, can’t you, like, slip him some money
or something?
Do people like money? Is that what you’re asking?
Now, is that a smart thing to say on a
holiday that’s basically national sex night?
This is ridiculous. You know, I’m gonna go talk to
the maître d’.
I don’t know. I’m, I’m gonna flirt with him.
I’m still sleeping with you tonight.
Hi there. What’s your name?
Oh, boy, it is crazy in here tonight, huh, Glen?
Yes. Oh, bet your girlfriend is super bummed you had
to work tonight. Anyway, look, we have been waiting a
while, and I just…
You don’t have to call me ma’am.
I mean, we’re basically the same age.
How old are you?
Just shut up, Glen. Come on, let’s get out of
here.
Because I’m young. Let’s go.
It is freaking amazing.
I was just hungry and cranky, and I’ve never been
called ma’am before.
Kind of. When was the first time someone called you
sir?
Can you believe when I met you I was 22?
I mean, it’s crazy. Where did all that time go?
Yeah, go ahead and make jokes, but your thirties are
almost over.
You’re closer to 40 than you are 30.
Won’t make us any younger.
Okay, like what?
Yeah. No one wants to see that. Hey, how about
skinny dipping at the beach?
Oh, there’s a screening of Moulin Rouge, I heard the
crowd sings along and stuff.
Midnight.
Okay, great. Oh, wait. Uh, it’s sold out.
Yes.
Happy Valentine’s Day!
Cleaning up is not young and fun.
Leonard says you’re pregnant.
Don’t say anything. act surprised when she tells you. All
right, how you want to do this?
Oh, my God, I can’t believe it.
Are, are you not happy about this?
No, no, come on. Come on, you’re not gonna get
fat. You’re gonna be beautiful and glowing and, and have
the cutest little baby bump ever.
Oh, that’s all right. All I heard was skinny.
Yeah, I’m sure it was just the initial shock of
it all.
Yeah, yeah, we should go out.
Uh, I don’t know, a bar?
We can, but all right.
Okay, look, we don’t have to go anywhere. We can
just, you know, stay here and hang out in the
hot tub.
Yeah, yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes.
And whenever you’re hungry, you’ll be in a minivan with
Cheerios all over the floor.
Oh, tell us.
Oh, come on, we’re all grown-ups. We’ve all done it.
Wait, I remember that. Hang on. You did it at
our place?
No.
No, we’re a team. If you can’t go in, we’re
not going in.
Okay, it’s not like she’s got the Christ child in
there, all right? Oh. It’s Leonard. He says Sheldon’s drunk
and they’re gonna do karaoke if we want to join
them.
What’s it say?
Hey, guys. Congratulations.
So, you gonna get up there later?
Are we an item? Girl, quit playin’.
Say there’s another and look right in my eyes.
And I was like, baby, baby, baby, ooh, like, baby,
baby, baby, no, like, baby, baby, baby, ooh, I thought
you’d always be mine.
That was such a fun night.
Yeah, yeah. I was a little surprised when you decided
to beat-box.
Well, I am so happy for Howard and Bernadette.
Babies? Well, I’m not in a rush but someday, yeah,
sure. What about you?
On the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity.
W, wait a minute. You mention his birthday and he
vanishes?
Well, where is he?
Oh, my God.
Yeah, what is the problem? Is it about getting older?
Oh, poor thing.
You know, if you had a party now, you have
plenty of friends that would love to come.
Yeah.
All right, what about music?
No music it is.
Thank you so much for helping us, Stuart.
Okay, sweetie, we’re on the clock here. Can you hate
yourself and frost at the same time?
Yeah, birthday party first. Pity party later.
You know, to be fair, we did get married in
Vegas and didn’t invite her.
Happy birthday!
Okay, this is ridiculous. Sheldon? Can I come in?
Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week,
even though I’ve clicked unsubscribe, like, a thousand times. So,
what’s going on?
I get that. Hey, you want to just bring a
few people in here? You know, Wil Wheaton in the
bathtub, Batman on the toilet. It’ll be like the weirdest
Comic-Con ever.
Oh, pl, you’re not ruining it. Look, at some point,
Raj will try to get everyone to do the Electric
Slide. Now, that will ruin it.
That’s fine. You know, I hate that your sister and
her friends used to torture you. But what I hate
even more is, if I was there, I would have
tortured you, too.
My point is, there was a time I never would’ve
been friends with someone like you, and now you are
one of my favourite people. So, if what you need
is to spend your birthday in a bathroom, I’m happy
to do it with you.
Sweetie, you are weird. Everyone knows you’re weird, but they’re
all still here because they care about you so much.
Okay, everybody, Sheldon is gonna come back out, but I
think he’s a little embarrassed, so let’s all be extra
nice, okay?
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Stuart didn’t get to speak.
You nailed it.
Okay, while they get the cake, Sheldon, I just want
to say, I hope you didn’t think you were gonna
get through tonight without a hug.
Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday,
dear Sheldon, Happy birthday to you.
Is that a pregnancy thing?
But now you’ll be able to make your own milk
to eat the cookies with.
Oh, sure. Let me see it.
Raj, I got you this before we split up, but
couldn’t return it and thought you’d like to have it.
Happy belated Valentine’s Day, Emily.
Nice, or is she trying to manipulate him?
I know one way to find out. Sniff this.
Come on, just open it.
Well, never hurts to have a spare.
See, she’s trying to get you back. Now, that is
exactly what I would’ve gotten you if I had any
idea what it is or what you do.
Yeah, yeah, and beauty’s on the inside, size doesn’t matter,
how much she spend?
Okay, so, she drops off a five hundred dollar gift
and she’s not trying to get back together with you?
Okay, answer it. Just be strong. And if she starts
to cry, don’t make any promises. And most importantly, put
it on speaker so we can hear.
I know, but you did it. I’m so proud of
you.
Say hi to Emily for us.
Sheldon, did you draft the contract?
Ooh. You’re gonna make out so hard tonight.
What?
If you guys would shut up, I could tell you.
Oh. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
You know what, hang on. What if Sheldon had no
choice but to be respectful?
No. What I’m saying is you could add a clause
to the contract that he can’t make fun of Howard.
Wow. That is a lot of whereupons.
Wait, wait, wait. What are these changes on page six?
Hey, guys.
Yup, so we brought you some lunch and we are
gonna go look for ’em.
So, how’s it goin’?
Is there anything we can do to help?
Wow, really? Called my bluff. All righty then.
Hey, wouldn’t it be funny if after all your years
of hard work, I’m the one who makes a scientific
breakthrough? He doesn’t think that’s funny.
Like this?
Oh.
How can you call yourself a scientist and run out
of solder?
Honey, honey, honey, let me stop you. That is, is
not a funny story.
Yeah, you guys run to the store and let the
women handle the science for a change.
Okay, so what is solder?
I mean, it’s crazy, isn’t it? I moved here from
Nebraska to be an actress, and now I’m sitting in
an engineering lab at Caltech helping to build a prototype
for a high-tech guidance system.
Oh, they went to the store to get solder, which
is metal you melt to make science things.
You were home alone and had no one to play
with?
I think we’re good.
Oh, the boys had to drive all the way to
San Bernardino for the solder and got a flat.
Why?
Un-freakin’ believable.
No. You know what? Don’t. Don’t. Let’s let them think
they’re getting away with it.
Mm-hmm.
All right, how are we gonna play this when they
return?
Sweetie, I know you think jokes like that are funny,
but do you really think you could handle making out
with both of us?
Yeah, that’s pretty good.
Okay, here they come.
Hey, what’s this?
Yeah. You know, I want to be upset, but we
did kind of have fun working on the prototype.
Yeah, it’s fine.
And he’s back in the closet.
Yeah.
What am I smelling?
That’s not what the forest smells like.
Okay, if that’s true, why aren’t there more genius squirrels?
You know, there’s a cabin in Big Bear that a
doctor I work with keeps offering me.
She.
But I could get her.
Sure.
I’ll see if it’s available.
Hey. Amy’s downstairs.
Uh, what, what you got goin’ on here?
I can see that. What team did you get?
Well, we’ll be in the woods.
Nice hat, Sheldon.
It’s so cute and rustic up here.
This place is great.
Well, she is taking me to an Indigo Girls concert,
so hold that thought.
This sucks.
You know, we could still go. A little rain isn’t
gonna kill us.
No.
Hey, let’s light a fire.
Got it.
Hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?
Not the drinking game, a drinking game.
All right, it’s called Never Have I Ever. The rules
are simple. Someone says something they’ve never done, but if
you have done it, you take a drink.
Okay. Calm down. I’ll go first. All right, let’s see.
Never have I ever…
Very funny. Okay, never have I ever… yeah, you know
what? Let’s just circle back.
Sheldon, what did you do?
What, he arrested you for that?
And then you got arrested.
How?
Fine, is that how you want to play this? All
right, never have I ever come up with a nickname
for my own genitals.
Yeah, go ahead.
I can’t believe this. You realize I make more money
than you?
We’re married. We’re supposed to share everything.
How long have you had this secret account?
Well, how much you got in there?
My God, Leonard, do you know what I could do
with that kind of money?
What good is it if you don’t use it?
Well, I have a secret I’ve been keeping from you,
too.
I hate my job.
Because I don’t feel good flirting with doctors for sales.
I mean, I know I make a lot of money.
But I haven’t been happy for a while.
Because I know how important it is to you that
I’m having some success.
Okay, really? So you’d be fine if I went back
to acting and waiting tables again?
Well, it’s not what I want to do.
Doesn’t matter what I want. Look, this job is gonna
get me out of debt. So I’m gonna do the
grown-up thing and see it through.
I guess.
I love you, too.
Well, guess I gotta drink.
What is the problem?
Well, why the hell did I memorize the Pledge?
Well, why are you fighting him on this?
Well, I will still come to your meeting.
Because it’s important to him, and when we signed the
roommate agreement, we made a deal.
Mm, I think so. Dragons, snow zombies, and all the
hot guys are dead.
Uh-oh, somebody’s still pouting.
If it’s because you lost a stick, I know where
it went.
You know you’re gonna make up with him. Can we
just skip to that part?
Really? The only adult?
All right, you would think the only adult wouldn’t let
something silly ruin our entire night.
Oh, he’s all bent out of shape about having a
roommate agreement meeting.
Don’t worry, he’ll come around.
You don’t know?
Come on, Sheldon, we’ll watch Game of Thrones over here.
Leonard’s being a jerk, so we’re gonna watch over here.
Yeah, come on, Raj.
May I take your cloak?
What’s up?
Where’d you get that from?
Ugh. Amy, why did you tell him that?
I don’t always defend Sheldon.
What about your weird relationship with him?
Okay, well, that was murder, this was an accident.
There you go.
Is he still wearing the Batman suit under the Man-Bat
suit?
Oh, hey, if you guys are free this weekend, I
won a night of wine tasting from work.
Mm-hmm.
All right, well, let me know if you guys want
to go.
The little choo-choo for toddlers?
Yeah, give her a break from, well, come on.
Hey, you ready to go?
What are you doing?
You actually smell the wine?
Are your sinuses acting up?
Hey, are you still hanging out with Bernadette tonight?
Oh, good for you.
No honey baked ham in a hot tub, got it.
Okay, we’re leaving, love you, bye.
You guys been here long?
Oh, yeah.
Uh, I don’t know.
Ah, there’s definitely some oak.
Oh. Zack, hi. You guys remember Zack.
We did.
Yes.
E equals MC squared. Yeah. E is for energy, M
for mass, and C for the speed of light.
Oh, Leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last
longer.
Uh, you know, I’m not really around that much. Amy
knows much more than I do.
We didn’t.
Helium.
Yes.
Yes. Pi.
More specific.
Yes.
Oh, that’s a Venn Diagram, and I remember because I
thought to myself, venn is he gonna stop talking about
this diagram?
Okay.
Sure.
No problem.
You really want me to pick up your mother all
by myself?
Or a way for you to avoid her?
Fine, if you really want me to, I will pick
your mom up.
Yeah, you know what, she is my mother-in-law, and I’d
like for us to have a good relationship.
Okay.
Or as I know him?
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
Wow. Didn’t even make it out of the parking lot.
Uh, you know what, enough about Leonard. Let’s talk about
you. What would you like to do while you’re here?
Well, I’d actually like for us to be close, but
maybe we start with our favourite books and work our
way up to my husband’s sex organs.
Um, does Pottery Barn, Spring count?
Uh, for starters, maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything I
say?
Uncomfortable.
Oh. Sorry. Didn’t know you made those. Hey, listen, what
if we have a little mother-in-law, daughter-in-law dinner tonight?
Or I invite a few girlfriends, ’cause hearing you say
the two of us just sent a chill right down
my spine.
You know, she’s my mother-in-law. Why can’t I bond with
her like that?
You know, being in a relationship with Leonard also comes
with its challenges.
Um, it has seat warmers.
How long have I had spinach in my teeth?
Okay, you know what? This is ridiculous. I’ve been trying
to make a connection with you all day, and clearly
I’m getting nowhere.
What I was seeking was some sort of friendship. But
at this point, I’ll take you not insulting me to
my face.
You’ve been doing it all day. Do you even know
what an insult is?
Okay, good example.
To be honest, I’m surprised you cared about the wedding
at all.
It was spur of the moment.
Thank you. So if we would have asked you to
come to Vegas to see us get married, you would’ve
come?
You really think we made a mistake?
Wow. Okay. Well, um, how about this? Maybe while you’re
still in town, Leonard and I could have another small
ceremony. You know, if you’re interested.
She would find it perfectly acceptable. You guys saw it.
We bonded.
Hi, how was the screening?
Ugh, I should’ve never bought him that colouring book that
explains Black History Month.
Uh, you know, it started a little rocky, but I
think we got to a good place.
Yeah, and when I dropped her off at the hotel,
she even gave me a hug.
No problem. Um, so listen, I don’t know if you
have any plans next weekend, but I kind of promised
your mom we’d have another wedding ceremony so she could
attend this time.
Yeah, kind of, but now we can invite our friends
and family.
Come on, it’ll be fun, and, you know, your mom
was genuinely hurt we didn’t invite her to the first
one.
Leonard, come on, she’s your mom. If we can do
something to make her happy, why wouldn’t we?
Hey, look, then forget about her, let’s do it for
us. We could keep it small and informal. This time
we can invite our families.
Thanks to overcrowding, yeah.
Oh, you have to invite him. I haven’t seen him
since the divorce.
Well, then it’s settled. Yay. So funny. I never thought
my second marriage would be to you.
Okay, so it’s not a legal ceremony, it’s just a
chance for us to redo our vows so everyone can
be part of it.
No.
I don’t see how I could.
I was kind of hoping you would.
Okay, wait, you’re inviting people to our wedding?
Okay, fine, but why would you invite him to our
wedding?
Yeah, I’m also doing it for Leonard. I think this
could really help their relationship.
Whew, chilly.
Sorry.
Alfred. Thank you for coming!
Thank you.
Uh, who’s hungry? We have a reservation at the best
restaurant in town.
No, of course not.
You know, Beverly, I know you and Alfred have your
differences, but if you think about it, if you hadn’t
married him, there’d be no Leonard. So that’s good, right?
Oh, maybe. Get closer.
Well, why is he turning here? The restaurant’s the other
way.
Oh, so follow him.
Well, go faster. You’re losing him.
You know what, flash your lights. Let him know it’s
you.
Hey.
So, what did we miss?
Yeah, I’m gonna call Bernadette and see what’s keeping them.
Oh, thanks for asking until I did.
Aw.
Um, if, if we want to order the soufflé, we
might want to get on that.
‘Cause they both turned their phones off.
Really? ‘Cause I love it.
