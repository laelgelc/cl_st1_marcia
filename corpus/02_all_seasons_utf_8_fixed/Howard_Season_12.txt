You know, that's how Neil deGrasse Tyson got his start.
He went from the Hayden Planetarium to guesting on the
local news to ruining everyone's favorite movies on the Internet.
Or worse, what if they're back early?
That was weird, right?
How come if I say that I get in trouble?
Nice try. You're gonna have to find some other way
to not hava sex with me tonight. And it's not
weather girl, it's weather woman.
Pull up, Raj, pull up!
You know, I cut you a lot of slack because
you come from another country, but you've been here a
long time.
What are you gonna do? He's from another country.
Your turn.
You called him Mike Tyson's little sister.
You're not a real married couple until you can pee
with the door open and she's okay with it.
She loves it.
What is wrong with Stuart's face?
Oh, my God, are they flirting?
Are you sure she wasn't trying to breathe life back
into him?
Bye.
So, what's her deal? Is she into you or does
she just hate her parents?
Well, she patted you on the head, so I'm guessing
she feels like you're such a good boy!
And now you're a good boy!
A lot of people have been asking that. He's... smiling.
Back when I was dating, I'd always wear a new
pair of underwear, just in case.
If there's a chance someone's gonna see you naked, it's
also polite to make sure you're well-groomed down there.
Well...
I do know.
If you're asking if you and Amy should spend the
next couple days running all over town searching for the
next clue, I'm gonna have to say yes.
Oh, it really is.
No, not even close. He thinks it's a clue to
a scavenger hunt.
Yeah, that's exactly what we did.
Yeah, that's exactly what I said.
Oh. Look what Halley drew.
It's pretty good, huh?
Wow. Gentile moms are tough.
Of course.
Don't you mean what are you gonna "Oompa Loompa doompety
do"?
I'm sorry. I'll stop.
And if not, swing by the chocolate factory and see
if they're hiring. That wasn't a joke. That was a
legitimate suggestion.
Something about babies crying and keeping them up all night;
it's not important. You guys should totally take a look
at it.
Okay. Guys, so what do you think?
How are you two married?
Enjoying your book?
Why do you keep poking at it?
You're the one who said you wanted to read more.
Hey. How was your night?
Reading.
That she can clearly do better, but that's not for
me to say.
Oh, come on, we're sitting right out here. They're not
gonna do anything.
I'd like to change my answer.
Hey. How was your date?
Wait, you're not seriously marrying a woman you've met once.
Because you're being dumb. You don't know anything about her.
I think that's a question for a licensed professional.
Raj is talking about marrying this woman he just met.
I told him it was dumb, and now he's mad
at me.
Why won't our friends just listen to us? We obviously
know what we're talking about.
Hey. Mind if I sit?
No.
Fine.
I can wait.
I've known you a long time. You believe in romance
more than any person I've ever met and it's hard
to see you give up on that. But if you
really think marrying this woman is gonna make you happy,
then you have my complete and total support. I will
be with you every step of the way.
So, hey, is this wedding gonna be in India?
Ugh.
What would you say if I told you I was
totally naked under this robe?
Really? Well, I did not see that coming. One second.
Wait. Stay in the mood. I'll put on our own
music and drown them out.
It's from my workout mix. It's what I listen to
when I'm firming up my glutes.
Sure.
Yeah?
I can't. I tried.
Wow. I wonder what that guy could've done to make
Sheldon not talk to him for 20 years.
Leonard, this is a safe space-- it's okay to be
vulnerable.
I wonder what Tam could have done.
I have his brother George's number-- he might know.
If you mean digitized, annotated and put online, it did.
All right, got his enemies list. Ooh, he updated the
interface. You can search by first name, last name or
length of grudge.
Let's see. Yep. Right here. Tam Nguyen.
Hold on. I have to agree to the terms of
service. No, I'm not a robot. Okay. "Which of these
are plants?" And we're in.
Well... "He knows what he did."
Yeah. Look at his list. Jim Henson for, quote, "putting
a terrifying, giant yellow bird on television and in my
nightmares."
Not Tam.
No idea. We're actually friends of Sheldon Cooper.
If you mean every other way, no.
Right. Because... you know.
Oh, come on, there's got to be something...
So, he was your best friend growing up?
Were there no other kids in Texas?
I know. Bernie came home pretty drunk. She tried to
sleep in the dryer.
Do I look like I just woke up?
Great. I'm gonna go say hey to Raj.
Hey, great show.
Nice to meet you. I'm Howard Wolowitz. Engineer, husband, father...
astronaut.
Well, I don't like to brag.
that might be fun.
No, I could find the time.
It's okay, I...
I'm-I'm just thinking about Raj.
He sort of hurt my feelings.
Why wouldn't he want me to be in his planetarium
show?
Sorry, it's just the director of the planetarium thought it'd
be fun for me to join Raj for one of
his shows, and he made it clear that he didn't
want me to.
I don't know. How sexy are we talking?
Wait, w-who are we talk...
Hey. Got a sec?
I just want to let you know I get why
you don't want me to be a part of the
planetarium show.
You don't want to talk about the stars next to
an actual astronaut. That would be like doing karaoke with
a rock star.
Listen, I understand you being intimidated, but I can't help
that I'm proud of being an astronaut. It's a big
deal.
Great. So you have no reason to be scared of
sharing the spotlight.
What's happening?
Thank you, Raj, that was a really nice introduction.
Honestly, lucky. Most astronauts have to train their whole lives.
I was just in the right place at the right
time.
Thanks, but if you want to talk impressive, this guy
right here discovered a planetary object outside the Kuiper belt.
He helped launch the New Horizons space probe.
And I was scared the whole time.
Wow. I don't think you've ever said that to me
before.
Aw, Raj, I love you, too.
Of course. I mean, how often do you get to
wear costumes to work?
Hey, this is not a costume. It's a choice. It's
a style.
Great. Can't wait.
I don't want to ruin the surprise. You'll see it
at work. Just a warning
No.
No.
Hello.
I see you are dressed as Doc Brown from Back
to the Future. May I assume that Amy is going
as his wife, Clara Clayton, from Back to the Future
Part III?
Yes. Looking good.
Hello.
Well, technically, the Supreme Court wouldn't determine a defendant's guilt
or innocence in a criminal matter. They could only reverse
or revamp a jury's conviction based on a constitutional or
statutory issue.
You're sitting in my spot.
Interesting fact
Interesting fact
Well, Gorblimey. You look like a thousand tuppence. Don't he,
Mary Poppins?
Jiff willikers, I am.
And I'm gonna sweep Ms. Poppins' chimney.
You know what, guys? You got us. Congratulations. Now why
don't you go back to your apartment and put on
your other costumes.
Did that guacamole taste weird to you? Tasted weird to
me.
Oh, come on. You thought it was funny when I
dressed up as Sheldon.
How?
Well, for what it's worth, I didn't think it was
a very good impression of you.
No, not at all. In fact, I find your voice
quite melodious.
What? I'm sorry. I-I couldn't hear the question. I just
heard the music.
Hey, guys, I need your help. Bernadette's still pretty upset
about your costumes.
Anyway, if you guys could apologize, it'd be a big
help.
I didn't follow that, but, then, between my wife and
that guacamole, I didn't get a lot of sleep last
night.
Yes. So when can you stop by?
Okay, how about this? You know in Star Wars when
R2 and Chewbacca were playing holochess?
Well, Chewbacca was losing and getting angry and...
Hey. Hey, that's my wife you're talking about. But yes,
let the Wookiee win.
Okay, lights on, or lights off?
I'm gonna hook up the garden hose, so it has
running water.
Same reason it's got electricity
How exactly are you pitching in?
So, what do you think? Pretty cool, huh? And when
our kids outgrow it, we can Airbnb it to other
people's babies.
You all right?
Ooh. As long as you're making sandwiches... You can laugh
at that one later, too.
Hey, thank you guys again for helping out yesterday.
You didn't lift a finger.
Leonard, do I detect a little swagger in your step?
Should we form a line, or just do it like
we're bobbing for apples?
Sure, sure. Is "Jet Ski" one word or two?
Halley, leave your brother's dirty diaper alone. Put that down.
That is not a hat. That is not a hat!
Oh! Okay. Everybody in the sink.
Wait, so those are the three? You're not even considering
mine? Why, because they're PhDs and I'm just an engineer?
I can tell you're stressed. If it helps, I withdraw
my proposal.
Fine. Then I'm back in the mix. Show me the
money!
Where are you going?
So Leonard still hasn't made a decision yet?
Did you break out the sad eyes?
Oh. Yeah, that's just Bernadette. She's been hiding out in
there all week.
I don't know. She's been a little overwhelmed at work.
And, frankly, me and the kids are a lot. She
just... needs some downtime.
Sure. That's how marriage works. Three years ago... I told
her I got life insurance, and I totally didn't. Someday,
she's gonna find out. I'm gonna say, "Ha-ha! I know
you've been hiding in the playhouse."
Whose side are you on?
Huh. Sounds like Penny's in there, too.
Did you go with Crow Lady?
What was the case?
Yeah, there's a nice... coolness between us.
Yeah, you can't make my wife sit on the floor.
Guys, guys, there's a simple solution.
All right. Let's keep thinking.
Hi.
What? He's our friend. What's up, pal?
Yeah...
Yeah...
Well, if it helps, I was really nervous my first
time with Bernie. Mostly because I was worried my mom
would walk in.
Yea-- Yeah.
Hey, have you checked the dates on these? They're all
expired.
What are you guys up to?
Cool. Can I see it? Hmm? Sure. Oh. Interesting. I
think this is one of those disappearing whistles.
Voil !
Look in your pocket.
Sorry, a magician never shares his secrets.
Sold!
Voil!
It's okay. Here, let me show you again.
The rings don't roll their eyes at me.
What's up?
What?
Tell you what, you take my father-in-law, I'll take yours.
What if I throw in a quarter?
About to sh**t some dancing jackass.
And now I'm doing a victory dance.
Fortnite. A bunch of people parachute onto an island and
fight it out to be the last man standing.
I don't know if you'd like it. It's kind of
for gamers.
All right, give it a shot. This one's how you
move, this is how you shoot. "A" jumps, "B" puts
you into build mode.
Oh, sounds like me on our honeymoon.
Oh, now it sounds like you on our honeymoon.
Oh, gosh, my Russian's a little rusty.
Okay. This paper is called "Examinations of a Super-Asymmetric Model
of the Universe" by Dr. Vasily Gregora-poli-popivich.
No, doesn't look like it. This is from 1978.
Kind of rolls right off your tongue, doesn't it?
Well, he's gonna be less happy about this, uh... "The
super-asymmetric model "is inherently flawed and does not bear the
weight of further examination." Hmm.
Sounds like it.
That's easy. Just go up to him and say, "Sheldon,
Raj has something to tell you."
Or even better
Yes, we are.
Hey.
Don't beat yourself up. It's a hard game.
I see your ramp. I'm coming for you.
Gotcha.
Want to play again?
What?
Because he fights a Russian. I'm sorry about her.
Hey-a!
Nice going.
Yeah, Amy asked if we had one she could borrow
and I just want to make sure it still works.
Not sure. I used to record a lot of Jeopardy!
for my mom, but if I push play and you
see some naked people...
Ooh, we were looking for "vintage '80 s erotica," but
I'll accept it. Hello, everybody. I am The Great Howdini.
It's just a practice tape from when I was trying
to become a member of the Magic Castle.
Oh, I never went through with it. I watched the
tape and realized I wasn't good enough. You know that
trick where you saw a mannequin in half?
Thank God it was not a lady. I'd just be
getting out of jail.
Really? You always called magic dumb.
It's fine. I don't need to be a member of
the most elite magical society on the face of the
earth.
Oh, we don't have to show it to them.
What's all this?
Why is it all in the living room?
That's sweet, but I'm not that guy anymore. I've outgrown
it.
Whoa, whoa, no one's sabotaging anybody.
I thought you hated your mom for making you do
that.
Yeah.
I've got magic to do, just for you. I've got
miracle plays to play. I've got parts to perform, hearts
to warm. Kings and things to take by storm. As
we go along our Way. Hello. I'm The Great Howdini
from Altadena, California. I have no brothers or sisters and
my favorite thing to eat is grilled cheese.
No, I have glitter in my nose.
You know what, it has been so much fun working
on this with you, but...
It hasn't. I'm not gonna audition.
You didn't raise me at all.
I'm not scared. I don't like the act. It's over-the-top
and weird and has more jazz hands than magic.
You seemed like you were so happy, and then when
I tried to say something, you seemed like you were
so mad.
Well, that's honest. But if I'm gonna go through with
this, I have to do it my own way.
Stop trying to make this your victory!
Hi, I'm The Great Howdini, and it's an honor to
be auditioning at the Magic Castle. Could I borrow your
watch, sir? Sure. Thank you. Ooh, Rolex, fancy. I'll get
it right back to you. Observe
Sounds fun. Bernadette and I are in.
No. I've been pretty annoying lately. She's gonna want to
shoot me.
Oh, no.
Everything okay?
He's got... bags. He's probably just delivering food.
She's a good tipper?
Really? You're picking her over me?
All right, the choices are-- get shot at or stay
here and listen to them fight.
Shot at.
Ha, ha! Oh. It's you.
I can't believe I did, either.
Sorry. That's gonna leave a bruise.
Does it hurt?
I do.
Hey!
I use my wizard eye to see what's on the
other side of the door.
Oh. Is it alone and unloved?
I open the door and say, "Hey, Raj."
Why don't you just call her? I'm sure you guys
can work this out.
Honestly, I think you dodged a bullet. I don't think
she was right for you.
What?
What did she say?
So I'm just supposed to lie to my friend?
Oh, that's nonsense.
Now what do I say?
So, my incredible wife has some exciting news.
Oh, okay, sorry.
It's her anti-inflammatory drug.
Wait, what?
I haven't started the new season yet.
Two behind.
Black Mirror?
I actually hadn't watched it yet, but thanks for ruining
the ending.
Yeah, who remembers the guy who was trying to find
India and discovered America instead? What was his name again?
That's terrible.
Why does this matter to you so much?
Wait, so what are you gonna do? Just badger her
until she says yes?
Would you like me to... heat things up?
Yeah, a new neighbor put in floodlights.
So, shall we?
You can, but it's okay if you don't.
I say we wait until his lights go off, and
then I make hot, motionless love to you. Don't move.
It's go time.
And his new balcony looks right down on our hot
tub, which meant we couldn't do anything.
Why do I share with you? You're such a yenta.
Is there anything you can do about it?
And then Andy said if we want privacy, we should
plant some trees. The only way I know how to
do that is to give a dollar and tree shows
up in Israel.
I want to see it!
Hey, I'm not sure we're in the right line. Is
this for the city zoning office?
You know, for... Maybe we should've done this online.
So, is there anything we can do?
Well, English, obviously.
This is starting to seem like more trouble than it's
worth.
We spent half the day down at the city planning
office, and didn't solve a thing.
So now we have to download all these forms and
fill them out.
I don't know.
Or instead of us?
See what I'm talking about?
Well, you know what they say
Yes.
Yes.
It's been here for years, Sheldon. It's fine.
Uh...
Hey. What's going on?
Sheldon, the deck is safe. You can walk on it.
Mm. So, what's up?
Are you kidding?
Really? "Aw"?
What did they say?
What's wrong with the one here?
This is just delightful.
Who cares?
No problem!
Oh, yeah, I would have forgotten, except for those nonrefundable
airline tickets to India I bought.
No, no. What's $3000 between friends? Yeah, I probably would've
just thrown it away on health care for my children.
Indian sushi? I need a change of underwear just thinking
about that.
Agreed, although I did have a pretty awesome bachelor party
planned for this weekend.
Well, I used my NASA connections to get us four
seats on that plane that lets you experience weightlessness.
I know, it would've been fun, but, hey, the next
time you decide to marry a woman you barely know.
Yeah. All right, let's do it.
You mean when we were all sad, desperate and horribly
alone?
Hey, who wants to hear some exciting news?
This weekend, I got us four seats on the Vomit
Comet.
He doesn't hate me. He's just disappointed that I'm not
any other man on the planet.
Well, these two are out. There goes our guys' weekend.
I'm not sure Bernie would like it. Maybe I'll invite
Stuart or Bert.
Hey, would you mind if Raj and I went away
this weekend?
No, just the bachelor party I had planned. I thought
we'd do it anyway.
Kinda. I mean, Sheldon and Leonard couldn't make it, so
Raj invited Anu and I asked Stuart.
Actually, I invited Bert before Stuart, but I don't know
why I just told you that.
Because I know you. You don't want to float weightless
in an airplane.
Bernie, you got sick from the teacup ride at Disneyland.
We were still in line.
No, I want you to go if you're gonna have
fun. I don't want you to go if you're gonna
be miserable and ruin it for everyone. Which is a
long way of saying I want you to go!
Of course.
I'm sorry. I just... didn't think you'd enjoy plummeting to
the Earth at 400 miles an hour.
And I'm married to her, which is quite the ride.
Not to brag, but I'm an astronaut, so I've been
weightless before. Can be pretty scary.
I'm sure it's just boilerplate.
Done.
Really? Well, I did not see that coming.
You're right. But I've done this before. And since you
really, really want to go, I'll stay here.
Unless you don't want to because I was right and
I do know you.
Apparently, 34000 feet that way, then straight back down, up
and down, over and over again until you throw up
food you didn't even eat.
Have a great conference.
I think I'm capable of babysitting.
What's the difference?
Oh, sounds like I do get paid. Don't worry. I
got this covered.
They're upstairs.
They're at daycare?
Why are you messing with me?!
Hey, guys.
I thought they were with you.
I'm kidding. They're at daycare.
Hey. You guys want to come hang out at my
place this weekend?
Uh, it's not babysitting. They're my children.
Oh. Well, for you guys, then, it is babysitting.
You can't insult my kids. I am offended.
What do you say? We'll play some board games. It'll
be like a party.
Someone doesn't remember college very well.
They're still asleep. Apparently, when I put someone down for
a nap, they sleep hard.
Bernadette thinks I have poor parenting skills.
Who can say? I'm bad at a lot of things.
"Scamps"?
Yeah, you're not their father. You can't experiment on my
kids.
No offense.
No, it was Mama's Boy. But the joke was on
them, because I love my mom.
And it's not really experimenting on the kids. It's more
like experimenting with the kids.
Okay, you know what, when they wake up, we can
try one or two of these.
Yeah, everything's great. I was just wondering if we had
any large barbecue tongs.
Nope, just playing games with the kids.
Love you, too, bye.
Okay, you want to engage the babies.
The babies.
Engage them for a minute and take note of their
reactions.
Okay, go.
35 seconds.
That's time.
I think these guys need to get some food.
No, by opening the door to a hangar and letting
the airplane fly in.
Have a great conference.
I think I'm capable of babysitting.
What's the difference?
Oh, sounds like I do get paid. Don't worry. I
got this covered.
They're upstairs.
They're at daycare?
Why are you messing with me?!
Hey, guys.
I thought they were with you.
I'm kidding. They're at daycare.

35 seconds.
That's time.
I think these guys need to get some food.
No, by opening the door to a hangar and letting
the airplane fly in.
I love you, honey, but think.
Are you gonna say Tom Hanks?
Hey. Kids asleep?
Why doesn't he like the night-light?
I'll go talk to her.
Honey, remember, she's my child, too. Hey, sweetie, I heard
you were afraid of the dark. I know someone else
who was afraid of the dark once. Your daddy, when
he was in space. And just like you, I was
wearing a full diaper.
What-- Oh. What's the occasion?
Absolutely not.
Because I don't want the whole world to know I
was the frightened little astronaut!
Sure. What's up?
No. It's great. I just don't want anyone to ever
see it or read it or know it exists.
Oh, easy for you to say. No one's gonna think
you're a coward.
Can't you just take my name off it?
Well, look, what if we made a few changes?
Well, nothing major. But see here on the cover, where
it says "frightened little," what if, I don't know, it
didn't say that?
Yeah, you're right. That doesn't quite pop. What about... The
Brave Astronaut? See, that's got some zip to it!
And here on this page, where I'm crying. What if,
instead, I'm... punching a meteor into the sun with my
bare fists?
I like the way you're thinking.
So what do you think?
Oh. No, I am wearing a shirt. It's just skintight,
so you can see my pecs.
Yesterday, when I made Stuart add them.
So, it's a children's book. I mean, cats don't wear
hats. And if someone gives you green eggs, it ends
with you on the toilet trying to make a deal
with God.
But in space, the other astronauts... made fun of him,
and that's a thing he doesn't want to relive.
Wow. That is quite the guilt trip. Are you sure
you're not Jewish?
Oh. You're sounding less and less Jewish.
"Once upon a time, there was a little astronaut who
was sitting in a rocket waiting to go to space."
And while all the other astronauts laughed and joked, he
stayed quiet, because he had a secret. He was scared.
He had another secret, too. He was only pretending to
be scared to trick the alien king. Ha-ha!
Fine. There was no alien. There was a bossy wife,
though. We'll get to her later.
This is a twist. Usually you're the one getting called
into H.R.
It's no big deal. I used to get called into
H.R. all the time. Ms. Davis is great. Pro tip
Maybe, but do not ask for that, on the wrist
or anywhere else.
It wasn't a moped. It was a scooter.
You do not want to walk into a scooter bar
and ask that question.
Yeah, the two of us, cruising around town looking for
women.
Oh, yeah. We drove away so fast.
I finally got my woman. Then my woman made me
sell it.
Are your eyes closed?
Okay, open them.
No, I bought me a scooter!
I wanted to see the expression on your face when
you saw how happy I was.
She's not gonna. I'm keeping it here at the university.
Yeah, whenever you want. Check it out. That there, son,
is horses of "eye-talian" thunder.
Oh. Just tossing out this old helmet I don't need.
I thought you were at the park.
Great story. I need to make a phone call.
Never mind.
Hey. You still mad?
Now, now, I asked you first.
I just didn't want you to worry.
I'm sorry, but you telling me what I can and
can't do is pretty damn emasculating.
It's a scooter. It can go on some highways.
I'm sorry, but I need to have something in my
life that reminds me I'm still a man.
I know that.
I don't know. Maybe I just miss the freedom I
had as a younger man.
It wasn't a curfew; it was just a time of
night where if I got home after that, she would
be mad.
I will!
Yeah, watch out, ladies.
Yeah, only condoms. He sees that car, right?
Jerk. On a positive note, the scooter helped Bert meet
a girl.
She's an E.R. nurse.
No. It was a real meet-cute. She popped his arm
back in the socket, and when he came to, they
exchanged phone numbers.
Okay. It's official. We're never going to see the Avengers.
He's got you there, Leonard. Or he doesn't. I don't
really care anymore.
Told you he was gonna mention Lady Gaga.
Yeah. Actually, I have a two-part question.
No, no, it's two. Part one
I have a question about the aliens you found.
Wow, that is not a great picture of you.
Relax. They're just having fun.
See? It's fun.
Hey, Bernie, look at this.
Fire away.
Quick question
So you really think they should do this? It wouldn't
just knock Pemberton out of Nobel contention, it would blow
up his whole career.
No, I meant it's a bad thing.
Don't you think it's better to take the high road?
So what's the worst thing you've ever done to get
something you wanted?
Oh, come on. I'll tell you mine.
Come on, just tell me.
There aren't hepatitises.
Oh, she still works there? Who was it?
You're right, it doesn't matter because I got the best
one. Was it Susan?
Good night.
So guess what. There was a waitress at The Cheesecake
Factory back in the day who kind of had a
thing for me.
Honest to God.
It doesn't even matter. I'm happily married. The point is
women-- plural-- find me appealing.
Wait. How do we know it wasn't Susan?
What type?
Are you saying I'm not a handsome guy?
Hold on, as we've established, a minimum of two women
think I'm attractive.
I didn't say it was her. I said it could've
been. It could've been anybody. Marta, Gina, Annalise...
Not just their names. The cars they drove, the color
of their eyes, and whether or not they had boyfriends.
Hey.
Listen, I did something kind of stupid today.
I went to The Cheesecake Factory to try to figure
out who that waitress was.
Don't worry, I didn't find out, because I realized I
didn't even care. W-While I was there, I started asking
myself, "Why does this mean anything to me?" And... I
guess the truth is it was all about my vanity.
And why should I need to be validated by another
woman liking me when the best woman in the world
already loves me? And I just wanted you to know
that.
And I regret that. Because the only woman I want
to creep out is the mother of my children.
Apparently, a guy who wants to have his feelings hurt.
How's that going?
Hey.
You know how you noticed that? Because you're over here
a lot lately.
Yes, she was. You didn't notice because you were in
the hot tub in the backyard eating Oreos.
So she's coming over again, huh?
It's my house. Don't you think you should ask me?
Doesn't she have her own place? Why don't you guys
hang out there?
It just feels like Denise is basically living with us.
You know, maybe you can spend half the time at
her place.
Oh. We were making fun of you.
I can see why she would say that, but why
do you?
No one thought you were.
So you're really gonna move halfway across the world?
Wow.
I thought you gave it to her the first time
you got engaged?
So, you're an Indian giver?
What? If he's gonna move to England, I need to
get all these out now.
Well, Raj is probably on his way to the airport.
Guess he's finally getting his big romantic movie moment.
Well, he'll have the rest of his life to explain
them to her.
Of course I don't. What am I supposed to do?
You're my best friend.
Raj! Stop!
Look... if you're getting on that plane because you love
Anu and you... can't stand the thought of spending another
day without her... then go. If not... then stay here
with...the people who love you.
I promise you it's not. Believe me, somewhere out there
is a woman who loves cooking shows and sweater vests
and... all the other dumb things you love.
Yes. And I don't think she's... waiting for you in
England. When you propose to someone in Notting Hill... it
should be to someone who knows what that movie is.
Sure.
I love you, too. No. No, no, that's not what's
happening here. Come on.
I had to buy a ticket. You owe me 300
bucks.
We were just calling to see if you'd heard yet.
Did anyone get to slap Sheldon?
So not Mr. and Mrs. Wackadoodle?
Quirky.
Hey. Can I help you?
Hang on a second. Sheldon? Sorry, he's not here.
I don't know if it helps you at all, but
I'm his best friend in the whole world.
And an astronaut. Come on, you can buy me a
cup of coffee, and I'll tell you about both.
Dinner ready?
Let me see. Oh, good, they used my NASA picture.
No. Leonard has always been kind of a monkey butler.
Whenever Sheldon got into a scrape, I was his go-to
guy.
You're kidding, right? W-- Remember when he had a panic
attack because his hand got stuck in a jar of
olives? I was the one who told him to let
go of the olives.
You know, that reporter asked me if I could put
him in touch with... Amy's best friend.
Doesn't have to be.
Let me tell you about the time Mr. Nobel Laureate
wanted olives...
Somebody just peed in the big girl potty.
Yes. You still feel good about leaving them with Stuart
and Denise for a couple days?
Or Stuart's last words.
I know. I can't wait. Fancy hotel room. The big
bed.
I told you these tickets weren't free.
You guys have showered together?
That wasn't a no.
How you doing?
Well, this is the furthest we've ever been away from
the kids. I was just checking to see if you're
okay.
Good. Me, too. I was just looking at the map.
Couldn't help thinking
This is our vacation. I thought we should do things
together.
How do you know that?
So what, now the Force is with you?
What?
What about her?
Buffy the Vampire Slayer?
No, that's not her.
Hey. What's going on?
Oh, that's nice.
All of them.
What happened, Stuart?
Did you at least save it for the tooth fairy?
Oh, good, you're here. Listen, we're thinking maybe we should
go back to L.A.
We just can't be this far away from the kids.
Bernie's having a meltdown, and, frankly, so am I.
Yeah, I wasn't sure what to do. Now I am.
We're going home.
