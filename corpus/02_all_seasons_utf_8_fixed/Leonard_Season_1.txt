Agreed, what’s your point?
Excuse me?
One across is Aegean, eight down is Nabakov, twenty-six across
is MCM, fourteen down is… move your finger… phylum, which
makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc’s capital idea, that’s
Port-au-Prince. Haiti.
Yes. Um, is this the High IQ sperm bank?
Thank-you. We’ll be right back.
What, are you kidding? You’re a semi-pro.
Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to
get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment.
I’m sure she’ll still love him.
Well, what do you want to do?
Okay.
I don’t know, I’ve never reneged on a proffer of
sperm before.
Okay.
See you.
No.
Not really.
I don’t care. Two millimetres? That doesn’t seem right.
Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
New neighbour?
Significant improvement over the old neighbour.
Hi.
Hi.
We don’t mean to interrupt, we live across the hall.
Oh… uh… no… we don’t live together… um… we live
together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms.
Leonard, Sheldon.
Hi.
Hi. Well, uh, oh, welcome to the building.
Oh, great.
Great. Well, bye.
Bye.
Should we have invited her for lunch?
We already watched the Season Two DVDs.
I think we should be good neighbours, invite her over,
make her feel welcome.
Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to
widen our circle.
Yes, and you’ve never met one of them.
I’m going to invite her over. We’ll have a nice
meal and chat.
Well it’s not difficult, you just listen to what she
says and then you say something appropriate in response.
Hi. Again.
Hi.
Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I
know that moving can be stressful, and I find that
when I’m undergoing stress, that good food and company can
have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative,
and I don’t have to tell you that, uh, a
clean colon is just one less thing to worry about.
Uh, yes.
Great.
Okay, well, make yourself at home.
You’re very welcome.
I have a board. If you like boards, this is
my board.
What?
At least I didn’t have to invent twenty-six dimensions just
to make the math come out.
In what universe?
Here we go.
Just sit somewhere else.
Sheldon, sit!
Well this is nice. We don’t have a lot of
company over.
Yes I now, but…
Yes, I remember.
I’m sorry.
I said I’m sorry.
Yeah, it’s like regular boggle but, in Klingon. That’s probably
enough about us, tell us about you.
I think what Sheldon’s trying to say, is that Sagittarius
wouldn’t have been our first guess.
Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job?
Oh, okay. I love cheesecake.
I don’t eat it, I just think it’s a good
idea.
So it’s based on your life?
Well, if that was a movie I would go see
it.
Well it sounds wonderful.
I don’t know.
Don’t.
Should I say something? I feel like I should say
something.
No, it’s not crazy it’s, uh, uh, it’s a paradox.
And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now
if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as
confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes
Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too.
Well, I didn’t make it worse.
Our shower works.
No.
No.
It’s right down the hall.
How so?
That’s not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer’s
had that episode.
The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
Excuse me?
Well I’m not trying to have sex with her.
What makes you think she wouldn’t have sex with me,
I’m a male and she’s a female?
I’m not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I’m just
trying to be a good neighbour.
That’s not to say that if a carnal relationship were
to develop that I wouldn’t participate. However briefly.
It’s Darth Vader shampoo. (There is a knock on the
door.) Luke Skywalker’s the conditioner.
See what?
This is not a good time.
That’s great, you guys have to go.
It’s just not a good time.
No. And she’s not a lady, she’s just a new
neighbour.
Uh-huh.
I’m not anticipating coitus.
Can we please stop saying coitus?
Come on, I’ll show you the trick with the shower.
Save it for your blog, Howard.
Uh, there it goes, it sticks, I’m sorry.
You’re welcome, oh, you’re going to step right, okay, I’ll….
The hair products are Sheldon’s.
A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I
would do you a favour for you.
Oh, I’ll probably say yes.
Wow.
Must we?
She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon.
Which is?
That’s a biological impossibility and you didn’t have to come.
Come on, you know how it is with break-ups.
Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim.
To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less
complicated. There’s some kind of dispute between Penny and her
ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She
just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.
No, Sheldon, there’s not going to be a scene. There’s
two of us and one of him.
I’ll do the talking.
Hi, I’m Leonard, this is Sheldon.
What did I just…. Uh, we’re here to pick up
Penny’s TV.
We’re not going to give up just like that.
Excuse me, if I were to give up at the
first little hitch I never would have been able to
identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of
the big bang.
Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we
should be able to figure out how to get into
a stupid building.
Just grab the door.
This is it. (Knocks.) I’ll do the talking.
I’m Leonard, this is Sheldon.
Oh. We’re scientists.
What?
I’m sorry.
Sheldon, I’m so sorry I dragged you through this.
And you were right about my motives, I was hoping
to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some
day led to sex.
Anyway, I’ve learned my lesson. She’s out of my league,
I’m done with her, I’ve got my work, one day
I’ll win the Nobel Prize and then I’ll die alone.
Thank you Sheldon, you’re a good friend.
We’re home.
Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the
rest is fairly self-explanatory.
No, it was a valid hypothesis.
Really? Great.
Our babies will be smart and beautiful.
Is Thai food okay with you Penny?
There you go, Pad Thai, no peanuts.
Uh, I’m not sure, everyone keep an eye on Howard
in case he starts to swell up.
Here we go.
Ask him for a napkin, I dare you. I’ll get
it.
Oh, hi Penny.
No.
They’re not going anywhere. So, you’re coming home from work.
That’s great. How was work.
So, you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system.
Yes.
So, there’s gonna be some furniture delivered?
Yeah, no problem.
Penny, wait.
Um, if you don’t have any other plans, do you
want to join us for Thai food and a Superman
movie marathon?
One.
Unless, Superman matches her speed and decelerates.
Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption
that Superman’s flight is a feat of strength.
I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge
you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.
Okay, her apartment’s on the fourth floor but the elevator’s
broken so you’re going to have to oh, you’re just
going to be done, okay, cool, thanks. I guess we’ll
just bring it up ourselves.
Why not?
We don’t need strength, we’re physicists. We are the intellectual
descendents of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever
and I can move the Earth, it’s just a matter…
I don’t have this… I don’t have this I don’t
have this.
Do you have any ideas?
Easy, easy. Okay! Now we’ve got an inclined plane. The
force required to lift is reduced by the sine of
the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so
about half.
Exactly half. Let’s push. Okay, see, it’s moving, this is
easy, all in the math.
What? Oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come
up here and help me pull and turn.
Men do things for women without expecting sex.
I’m doing this to be a good neighbour. In any
case, there’s no way it could lower the odds.
Almost there, almost there, almost there.
You okay?
So Penny’s a little messy.
Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has
the compulsive need to sort, organise and label the entire
world around them?
Well they don’t. Hard as it may be for you
to believe, most people don’t sort their breakfast cereal numerically
by fibre content.
Come on, we should go.
What are you doing?
Sheldon, this is not your home.
When the transvestite lived here, you didn’t care how he
kept the place.
What were you doing in his closet?
Oh, hey Penny, this just arrived, we just brought this
up, just now.
No.
No.
Well, we’ll get out of your hair.
It’s a joke.
Yeah, he didn’t tell it right.
Sheldon?
Sheldon? Hello?
Sheldon!
Are you insane, you can’t just break into a woman’s
apartment in the middle of the night and clean.
Do you realise that if Penny wakes up, there is
no reasonable explanation as to why we’re here?
No, no. You gave me an explanation, it’s reasonableness will
be determined by a jury of your peers.
Sheldon, we have to get out of here.
What?
That’s ridiculous.
Fine. I accept your premise, now please let’s go.
O-o-o-oh!
Oh, what the hell.
Morning.
I’m not surprised. A well known folk cure for insomnia
is to break into your neighbour’s apartment and clean.
You think?
You know what, you’ve convinced me, maybe tonight we should
sneak in and shampoo her carpet.
Yes! For God’s sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold
up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth.
No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.
Penny’s up.
How did she know it was us?
God, this is going to be bad.
Yes, but, only to clean.
I’m very, very sorry.
Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night.
Okay, look, no Penny, I think what you’re feeling is
perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when
you’re feeling a little bit less, for lack of a
better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some
more.
Sure, that’s another way to go.
You are going to march yourself over there right now
and apologise. What’s funny?
No.
It’s fine. You win.
What did she say? Is she still mad at me?
Oh.
Um, here’s the thing. Penny. Just as Oppenheimer came to
regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too
I regret my participation in what was, at the very
least, an error in judgement. The hallmark of the great
human experiment is the willingness to recognise one’s mistakes. Some
mistakes, such as Madame Curie’s discovery of Radium turned out
to have great scientific potential even though she would later
die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example,
from the field of ebola research….
Yeah.
Six two inch dowels.
One package, Phillips head screws.
No, please, we insist, it’s the least we can do
considering.
What?
It is an inefficient design, for example Penny has a
flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it
is wasted.
And control it how?
Also inefficient, and might be loud.
Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray,
a sluice and an overflow reservoir?
Oh, I’ve got it. How about if we replace panels
A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade
aluminium.
Meet back here in an hour?
Got it.
Don’t panic, this is what the last 97 hours have
been about.
Warriors, unsheathe your weapons, magic wielders raise your wands.
Stay in formation.
That’s alright, my tail’s prehensile, I’ll swat him off.
Raj, no, it’s a trap, they’re flanking us!
Forget the sword, Sheldon, help Raj.
Dammit man, we’re dying here.
The bastard teleported.
You betrayed us for money, who are you?
No, I can’t look at you or your avatar right
now.
Excuse me.
Oh, right, right right right right.
Penny, the mailman did it again, he… Oh! Sorry.
Not much. Bro.
Uh, yeah, uh, I just, I got your mail again,
here.
Oh no, that’s probably not such a good idea. Civil
servants have a documented propensity to, you know, snap.
No problem. Bye. Oh, and, bye, bro!
No, I’m fine. Penny’s fine, the guy she’s kissing is
really fine and…
What is wrong with you?
No, I’m not jealous, I’m just a little concerned for
her. I didn’t like the look of the guy that
she was with.
Yeah. He was kinda dreamy.
Well, I’m done with Penny. I’m going to be more
realistic and go after someone my own speed.
I don’t know. Olivia Geiger?
Yeah.
So?
Look, Howard, if I were to ask Lesley Winkle out
it would just be for dinner, I’m not going to
walk into the lab, ask her to strip naked and
dance for me.
Hello Lesley.
Lesley I would like to propose an experiment.
Right. Lesley, I would like to propose an experiment.
Pfff, I’ve done it, about two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone.
Anyway, I was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with
a neuro-chemical overlay.
I was going to characterise it as the modification of
our colleague/friendship paradigm, with the addition of a date-like component.
But we don’t need to quibble over terminology.
There is a generally accepted pattern in this area, I
would pick you up, take you to a restaurant, then
we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy featuring
the talents of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock.
Heartrate, pheromones, etc, yes.
You mean, kiss you now?
Can you define the parameters of the kiss?
Thank you. Shall I count down from three?
You proposed the experiment, I think you should present your
findings first.
None?
Ah. Well, thank you for your time.
None at all?
Hey, what’s going on.
Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn’t move. I
mean any more than the 383 miles that it was
going to move anyway.
You don’t know me, you don’t wear my chains… God,
that’s a good song.
I know what you’re thinking, I’ve taken your asthma into
account. There’s a feline geneticist in San Diego who has
developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos.
I’ve been thinking about names, I’m kind of torn between
Einstein, Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots.
Maybe, if it’s a cute little cuddly cat.
It doesn’t matter. The woman’s not interested in me, the
woman rejected me.
You’re right. I didn’t ask her out, I should ask
her out.
No, but you’re right. I should march over there and
ask her out.
Good afternoon Penny, so hi, hey. Uh… I was wondering
if you had plans for dinner.
There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner. Technically
it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever
it is consumed, so, to clarify here, by dinner I
mean supper.
Or dinner. I was thinking six thirty, if you can
go, or a different time.
Really? Great!
Us guys?
They…. might all be there. Or a subset of them
might be there, uh, algebraically speaking there are too many
unknowns, for example Sheldon had Quizznos for lunch, sometimes he
finds that filling, other times he doesn’t, it’s no fault
of Quizznos, they have a varied menu.
Great. Did we say a time?
And that’s still good for you.
Cos it’s not carved in stone.
I’ll get my chisel.
To… carve the… okay, I’ll see you six thirty.
How do I look?
Can you tell I’m perspiring a little?
Six thirty.
Is it too much?
By the way, if it should ever come up, you
didn’t join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken
carbonara sub at Quizznos.
No reason. Oh, you know what, maybe this isn’t such
a good idea.
You’re right, alcohol, poor judgement, it could go well.
You could have stopped at “it could go well.”
I mean, I’m a perfectly nice guy. There’s no reason
we couldn’t go to the restaurant and have a lovely
dinner. Maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we
have in common, “you love pottery? I love pottery!” You
know, there’s a pause, we both know what’s happening, I
lean in, we kiss, it’s a little tentative at first
but then I realise, she’s kissing me back, and she’s
biting my lower lip, you know, she wants me, this
thing is going the distance, we’re going to have sex!
Oh God! Oh, my God!
I’m having a panic attack.
If I could calm down I wouldn’t be having a
panic attack, that’s why they call it a panic attack.
Why?
Okay.
What?
Oh, who am I kidding, I can’t go through with
this, you need to call her and cancel.
Yes.
I don’t know. Tell her I’m sick.
Not the kind of illness that will make her want
to come over and take care of me, but nothing
so critical that she’ll feel uncomfortable going out with me
in the future if I want to try this again.
Give me the phone.
I can’t because if I don’t show up she’ll still
be expecting you.
Stop asking me all these questions, I need to take
another shower.
Oh, yeah, no. Turns out that Raj and Howard had
to work, and Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn’t
quite bounced back yet.
You’re kidding, well, then, that’s something we have in common.
We both have people in our lives who… want to
nip intestinal polyps in the bud.
Nothing.
Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has
happened since the 1930’s, and you can’t prove string theory,
at best you can say “hey, look, my idea has
an internal logical consistency.”
What’s new at the Cheesecake Factory?
Good. Good. And what about your, uh, hallway friend.
No, You were saying, but…
Just say the but thing about Doug and then I’ll
get her back.
Ugh, don’t get me started on rebound sex.
I’m not sure that I do. Um, is that one
thirty-six hour experience, or is it thirty six hours spread
out over say, one… glorious summer.
Well, chafing, right?
Of course, yeah, emotional chafing. Hey, do you want to
see something cool? I can make this olive go into
this glass without touching it.
Physics.
Actually, it’s centripetal force, which is an inward force generated
by the glass acting on the olive. Excuse me. Now,
if you were riding on the olive, you’d be in
a non-inertial reference frame, and would.
Yeah, I’m okay. Did you spill ketchup?
I’m not okay.
No, no, I’m okay, it’s stopped bleeding.
Yes, but I get car sick too, so…
Sorry about your car, by the way.
The poor guy on the bike. I had a nice
time.
Yeah.
This? No. No, of course not, this was just you
and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who
didn’t show up, because of work and a colonoscopy.
When I take a girl out on a date, and
I do, she knows she’s been dated. Capital D. Bold
face, underline, like Day-ted. I think I might have a
little concussion, I’m going to go lay down for a
while, good night.
Awesome!
Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Interesting.
Sounds like a breakthrough, should I call the science magazines
and tell them to hold the front cover?
Then I guess congratulations are in order.
I know, I’m familiar with you.
Yes, I was there.
What?
Well then we’ll avoid Finkleday, we’ll meet the new department
head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go.
Mahalo’s a nice touch.
Interesting, you should lead with that.
You don’t have buffets in India?
What. Howard brought a date?
Here comes our new boss, be polite.
Well, you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher
whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.
Morning
You’re making eggs for breakfast?
Huh? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast.
Sounds yummy. I look forward to your work with bacon.
You know, I’m sure if you just apologised to Gablehauser
he would give you your job back.
Okay. I’ll let you get back to fixing your eggs.
And we all thank you.
Hey, I just ran into Penny, she seemed upset about
something.
What’s with the fish?
What happened to your scrambled egg research?
So… fish.
Fish nightlights.
Mum’s the word. Sheldon, are you sure you don’t want
to just apologise to Gablehauser and get your job back.
Like luminous fish.
Right… I didn’t….
Thank you for coming on such short notice.
I didn’t know what else to do, he’s lost all
focus, every day he’s got a new obsession. This is
a particularly disturbing one.
Because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century
is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes.
Really, when was the last time you left the house.
That was three weeks ago.
Where are you going?
Oh.
I see.
Sheldon? Your mum made dinner.
That is a lovely story, um, are we going to
do anything about Sheldon?
Sounds like a wise man.
A death ray?
No, we’re not, we’re not, not a couple, two singles,
like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that…. are friends.
This is ridiculous. Dammit, Sheldon, snap out of it. You’re
a physicist, you belong at the University doing research, not
hiding in your room.
Really? That’s impressive.
Hey, how did it go?
Really? What happened?
That narrows it down.
No, no, no, no, Orcs are magic, Superman is vulnerable
to magic, not to mention, you already lost Godzilla to
the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk.
And Orcs!
Just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers.
I’m sorry. Give him a hamburger.
Make it two.
Hey Lesley.
Lesley, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from
Sheldon and me.
Lesley and I do research together at the University.
What happened to Elliot Wong?
Yeah, sure, why not.
Why at my place?
Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting
me in advanced placement classes wasn’t getting me beaten up
enough.
Lesley? No, no-oh, what are you kidding?
Thank you Sheldon.
What did Penny mean, you’d make a cute couple?
If Penny didn’t know that Lesley had already turned me
down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought
that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she, Penny,
had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But
because she did know that I had asked Lesley out
and that she, Lesley, had turned me down then she,
Penny, could be offering consolation. That’s too bad, you would
have made a cute couple. But while thinking, good, Leonard
remains available.
How so?
Well, what do you think.
Thank you.
That was fun, Lesley, thanks for including me.
Uh, sure, why not.
Really?
I thought you weren’t interested in me.
You mean my cello?
No kidding?
Gee, uh…
Penny? What about her?
Well, I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast,
which could give a positive urine test for opiates but
certainly not dilate my pupils, so I guess there’s no
point in bringing it up.
No. No, there’s nothing going on between Penny and me.
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.
Yeah, yeah it is good. Did you want to start
now?
Oh. Okay. A little musical foreplay. Terrific.
I’m good, I’m good to go.
Hey, what’s the matter?
Are you sure?
Oh yeah. But doesn’t that fix the problem you’ve been
having?
Thank you, I’ll see you at work.
You can stare at your board all day Sheldon, she’s
still going to be right.
Oh, hi.
Pretty good.
Pretty, very, there’s really no objective scale for delineating variations
of good, why do you ask?
Sheldon!
Wuh, I don’t…. th-th-th-that’s really two different questions, uh, I’m
not…. Sheldon, we have to go!
Thank you. What did she mean, she’s happy for me?
Is she happy because I’m seeing someone, or is she
happy because she thinks that I’m happy, because anyone who
cared for someone would want them to be happy, even
if the reason for their happiness made the first person
unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is
now romantically unavailable to the first person.
You know what, I’m being ridiculous. But who cares what
Penny thinks, Lesley is a terrific girl, she’s attractive, we
like each other, she’s extremely intelligent.
She fixed your equation.
You don’t believe in luck.
Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with
Lesley, I’m not going to pass that up for some
hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may
not want me to be happy with a woman who
is currently making me happy.
Yeah.
Hey, Lesley.
Brrrr. Why are you smashing a flash frozen banana.
So anyway. Hello.
Just extending the intimacy. Do you want to slip over
to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?
I’m not sure, but I think I’m about to discover
how the banana felt.
Who wouldn’t?
Yeah, well, I’m just glad to be a part of
it. So what happens now?
Oh. Okay. Thank you.
You want to make plans for New Years.
Sorry.
Doctor what?
Wha… how did it get on the internet?
Well, how did you know about it?
Well, that part’s true!
No kidding.
Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted.
Really?
Oh, to be honest, I don’t think it’s going to
work out.
Well what did she mean by that? Was that just
a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for
attention?
Are you even listening to me?
Okay then. You know, you can grow the ingredients for
soup.
Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you
lose.
I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly
savage pre-adolescent Jews.
Sheldon, let it go.
You hid behind a tree yelling “get the kid in
the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.”
Hello Penny.
A party?
Yeah, I don’t know, Penny…
We’re really more….
But thanks, thanks for thinking of us.
Is there a theme?
He’s asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction,
fantasy…
I’ll get it.
Oh, no.
We all have other costumes, we can change.
Okay, how about this, nobody gets to be The Flash,
we all change, agreed?
I call Frodo!
You went with Thor?
Hey, Sheldon, there’s something I want to talk to you
about before we go to the party.
No, it’s not…
Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny
to see me in the context of her social group,
and I need you not to embarrass me tonight.
For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle
name is Leakey.
All I’m saying is that this party is the perfect
opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of
her peer group. A potential close friend and… perhaps more.
I don’t want to look like a dork.
Hey, sorry we’re late.
Actually, Penny, he’s Rob…
Oh, he’s the Doppler Effect.
Okay.
We’re socialising. Meeting new people.
She’s not Catwoman, she’s just a generic cat.
Where do you get this stuff?
I want to get to know Penny’s friends, I just,
I don’t know how to talk to these people.
How so?
Go on.
Then what happens?
This is ridiculous, I’m jumping in.
No, you’re coming with me.
Come on.
Yes. But I need a wing-man.
Hi.
Why don’t you just tell people you’re a zebra?
Because I’m Frodo.
Oh no.
That’s Penny’s ex-boyfriend.
If he were any bigger, he’d have moons orbiting him.
Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed
the party and Penny doesn’t even want him here.
Maybe they just want to be friends.
Then he and I are on equal ground.
Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of
his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his
choice of female partners.
Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in
the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha
males. We shouldn’t have to back down.
No. I’m going to assert my dominance face to face.
Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.
No, I’m a Hobbit.
Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle
Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior.
I think we’re all talking to Penny here.
Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate
me. I mean, you can’t compete with me on an
intellectual level and so you’re driven to animalistic puffery.
No, I said animalistic. Of course we’re all animals, but
some of us have climbed a little higher on the
evolutionary tree.
No, Penny, it’s okay, I can handle this. I’m not
a dwarf, I’m a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons
in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term
memory?
A homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
I think I’ve made my point.
There’s not going to be a confrontation, in fact I
doubt if he can even spell confrontation.
Yeah, no, I’m fine. It’s good, it’s a good party,
thanks for having us, it’s just getting a little late
so….
What’s that?
No.
Good night Sheldon.
Hi Penny.
I’m fine.
It’s not your fault.
So why was he at your party?
There there.
Nothing, you’re perfect.
Yes you are.
Penny?
How much have you had to drink tonight?
Are you sure that your being drunk, and your being
angry with Kurt doesn’t have something to do with what’s
going on here?
Yeah, I’m a frickin’ genius.
Because if all guys were like me, the human race
couldn’t survive.
Probably.
That’s right, you saw what you saw. That’s how we
roll in The Shire.
Here, let me try. Call McFlono McFloonyloo. Heh-heh.
So? We’ll start now.
Hey Penny, come on in.
Sure. What’s going on.
So, if you don’t like this Christie, why are you
letting her stay?
Oh, I don’t think she’s a whore.
Okay, fine, we’ll just play one on one until he
gets back.
Well the only way we can play teams at this
point is if we cut Raj in half.
Great idea.
It’s the only way we can play teams.
Penny, you are on fire.
Well, to be fair, he is also a rather unpleasant
winner.
You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe
we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime.
I guess for you that’s an option.
Good night.
She’s an enigma, Raj.
She’s gone, Sheldon.
What’s wrong?
Are you sure?
No, take the couch, or my bed, I just got
new pillows, hypo-allergenics.
Let me guess, you have a problem with this.
It’s up to you, crazy person’s choice.
Your friendship means a lot to me as well, what
else?
So?
I’m sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny
stay we might succumb to cannibalism?
Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off
our bones while we sleep, you can stay.
I’ll get you a blanket and a pillow.
Here you go.
Sorry about that.
FYI, his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass
case under the UV light.
Well, sleep tight.
Funny expression, sleep tight. It refers to the early construction
of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes
which would occasionally… sleep tight.
What are you doing?
Penny’s still sleeping.
I know, I know, look, you have a TV in
your room, why don’t you just have breakfast in bed?
Almost 6
Oh, no, it’s 6
Leonard.
Penny, you’re always welcome to stay with us.
For one thing you live with your mother.
Sheldon you just can’t dictate…
Howard, can’t you see she’s using you?
We can’t order Chinese food without Wolowitz?
I see a problem.
So, we’ll just order three entrees.
Can we get an order of dumplings, but with three
instead of four.
This isn’t a substitution, it’s a reduction.
Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that’s twelve, we’ll
each have four.
If we have extra, we’ll just take the leftovers home.
Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let
me invite Penny then you would have had your fourth.
We don’t order egg rolls.
Here’s an idea, why don’t we just go out for
Indian food.
Yeah, we can always divide soup.
Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your
friend Christie,
Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something
we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?
Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.
Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing
with her and her girlfriend.
So?
Aaah, for God’s sake, Sheldon, you are driving me crazy.
No, I’m pretty sure my anger’s with you.
Who are you calling?
Sheldon, think this through, you’re going to ask Howard to
choose between sex and Halo.
You’re right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human
contact.
Now, Raj, kill Sheldon.
Well then start throwing grenades.
That will do, Raj, straight for the tank.
There’s a sniper, use your rocket launcher.
I thought I heard something.
No, never mind, alright, go.
Problem?
Okay, now, do you really need the honorary Justice League
of America membership card?
Why?
Hi.
Hi!
Yeah, we’re not like Haroun and Tanweer!
Yes.
Not at all.
Bye!
Actually, I read somewhere that it’s one of the most
popular programmes in India.
I bet you’re right.
I’m not a big fan of musicals, but I love
that show.
What?
Well, maybe we are like Haroun and Tanweer.
Hey, I thought you were finding new friends.
So don’t call her.
So call her.
I’m done, anybody else?
Look on the bright side, she might turn out to
be a nice, beautiful girl.
Oh, hey.
His mom’s been saying that for years. What’s up?
Oh, great, well the key to acquiring proficiency in any
task is repetition.
Look, Penny, we’d love to help you, but Raj is
going through some stuff right now. And besides, he doesn’t
drink, so… Really? Um, Raj is going through some stuff
right now and he’d like to take up drinking.
Thank you. This drink is a wonderful example of how
liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container.
Thank you.
Whatever you recommend.
It’s amazing.
Um… Raj.
Wait a minute, what’s the plan here? Let’s say he
meets her and he likes her and they get married,
what’s he going to do, stay drunk for the rest
of his life?
You have a drink that’ll make him less obnoxious?
What happened?
What?
I’m pretty sure her name’s Lalita.
We all know the reason. Sheldon, what are you getting
at?
Beats the hell out of me.
Doctor and Mrs Koothrappali, in all fairness, it wasn’t entirely
Raj’s fault.
No, I’m Leonard.
You left with his date. Friends don’t do that to
each other.
Take it, Raj. It’s more than I’ve ever gotten.
Hold on. What happened with you and Lalita?
So you’re not going to see her again?
I wonder who’s going to tell his parents they’re not
having grandchildren.
I don’t believe it, what’s gotten into him?
You didn’t?
Okay, the X10 s are online.
Hello.
Hang on, hang on, do you not realise what we
just did.
No, no, no, you don’t get it, um, Howard, enable
public access.
No, hang on, hang on. See!
Because we can.
Wireless webcams, wave hello.
Who’s running the red Corvette?
Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
It’s from the Institute for Experimental Physics. They want us
to present our paper on the properties of super solids
at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates.
Okay… if I may drill down to the bedrock of
my question, why did you throw it out.
Forget the parties.
Are there any other honours I’ve gotten that I don’t
know about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with
my name on it?
Shut up, Howard. Sheldon, we have to do this.
Okay, let me put it this way, I’m doing it.
Oh, come on. The only reason you’re the lead author
is because we went alphabetically.
Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis.
So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take
your word?
Alright, I don’t care what you say, I’m going to
the conference and I’m presenting our findings.
You forbid it?
Oh, you admit that it’s our work.
Ah!
Not only is he still not talking to me, but
there’s this thing he does where he stares at you
and tries to get your brain to explode. You know,
like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners? You know, bzzz-pchew!
Never mind. How about this one. It says, “I know
my physics, but I’m still a fun guy!”
They don’t, that’s why I saved this one.
Is this all stuff you want me to try on?
Oh.
Oh, that’s the bottled city of Kandor.
You see, Kandor was the capital city of the planet
Krypton, it was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and
then rescued by Superman.
It’s a lot cooler when girls aren’t looking at it.
Great, be right back.
Here?
No, I’m not shy.
I know you won’t look, why would you look, there’s
nothing to see, well, not nothing….
Putting them on.
No. No. Scientists do not compromise. Our minds are trained
to synthesise facts and come to inarguable conclusions. Not to
mention, Sheldon is batcrap crazy.
Oh, careful. That’s my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit.
Because it’s not a costume, it’s a flight suit.
Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit.
Ah. Technically yes, but, if you’ll notice, it’s reversible. So
it works as two.
Yeah. Everything since the eighth grade.
My last growth spurt.
Great.
Hey, Sheldon, I’ve been thinking, instead of arguing about this
why don’t….
What…
Okay, I’m leaving for the conference.
Sheldon I didn’t mean it like that.
I don’t know, I wasn’t choosing my…
No, no not at all. A little bit.
Okay, I’m going to ask you one more time, we
did the work together, lets present the paper together.
Let’s go.
You’re right, this side does look better.
You’re kidding.
All? In particle physics, twenty five is Woodstock.
I wasn’t expecting such a crowd, I’m a little nervous.
A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there’s
this farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won’t
lay any eggs. So, he calls a physicist to help.
The physicist then does some calculations, and he says, um,
I have a solution, but it only works with spherical
chickens in a vacuum. Right?
It’s a classic, right?
So, in conclusion, the data show that at temperatures approaching
absolute zero, the moment of inertia changes, and the solid
becomes a super-solid, which clearly appears to be a previously
unknown state of matter. Thank you. Are there any questions?
Any other questions?
I didn’t skip it, it’s just an anecdote. It’s not
science.
You are not Isaac Newton.
You cannot possibly be that arrogant.
Look, if you weren’t happy with my presentation then maybe
you should have given it with me.
Really, so why did you come?
I didn’t screw it up.
I’ve had enough of your condescension. Maybe I didn’t go
to college when I was eleven like you, maybe I
got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you
are not the only person who is smarter than everyone
else in this room. No offense. And I am clearly
not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and
has an ego in need of constant validation.
Yes. My name is Dr Leonard Hofstadter, and I could
never please my parents so I need to get all
my self-esteem from strangers like you. But he’s worse.
You cannot blow up my head with your mind.
Stop it.
You were trying to blow up my head.
It wasn’t, it was not, you are a nutcase.
Stop, stop it, quit it.
Vulcan nerve pinch!
You’re lucky I didn’t run you over.
You’re right, I’m the problem, I’m the one that needs
help.
Excuse me. Is there anything you’d like to apologise for?
What?
Oh jeez. Is this suit really look that bad?
See, the liquid metal Terminators were created in the future
by Skynet, and Skynet was developed by Miles Dyson, but
that future no longer exists, due to Dyson’s death in
Terminator 2.
Skynet is kinky? I don’t know.
Alright, oh wait, they use it to in…
What the hell is that?
What? Oh we just had to… mail some letters and
throw away some chicken.
Oh, I give up.
Believe it or not, personal growth. What happened?
No you don’t. No he doesn’t.
Oh, congratulations, what a lucky break.
No you don’t. He doesn’t.
No.
Because…. uh, Friday, we are attending a symposium on molecular
positronium.
No, it’s this Friday, at eight.
See you.
Yes, I did.
So?
Sheldon, are you worried about your safety.
That’s very true.
What?
It’s two o’clock in the morning
I highly doubt that. Go away. Are you still out
there?
What?
What, what, what, what, what?
Sheldon, what is it?
What was I supposed to say.
That would have hurt her feelings.
Yes.
And what would I have said afterwards?
I couldn’t say that, I would have to say, you
were terrific and I can’t wait to hear you sing
again.
It’s the social protocol, it’s what you do when you
have a friend who’s proud of something they really suck
at.
Well now you are.
Yes.
Oooaw. This would be so much easier if I were
a violent sociopath. What?
How?
You told her I lied, why would you tell her
I lied?
I’m sorry, I’m not seeing the help.
Oh, I’m getting a bad feeling.
Your cousin Leopold?
What’s important?
Do you have a cousin Leopold.
I don’t get it, I already told her a lie,
why replace it with a different lie?
Un-unravelable?
Okay, why would I go to a drug intervention for
your cousing.
We’re going to Long Beach?
Oh, come on!
So he goes back into rehab?
You still told her I lied.
I don’t know. How am I supposed to remember all
of this.
So she’s expecting me to lie about going to a
symposium in Pasadena, when in actuality we’re pretending to go
to a drug intervention in Long Beach?
Oh hey Penny, wow, look at you, all ready for
your showcase, you look great.
Oh, well, thankyou.
I don’t know what to say.
Oh, okay, alright, good.
Howard, I’m sorry… we’re… we’re
I don’t know what to say.
Howard, listen…
Well… I don’t know what to say.
Oh, another hug, thank you.
Thanks Penny.
No, we’re not going to Long Beach.
Because Sheldon doesn’t have a drug addicted cousin Leopold.
Wait, are we really going to Long Beach?
Let it go, Sheldon, the murderer was the first mate
whether it makes sense to you or not.
What are you talking about, it’s fine, she bought it,
it’s over.
Why not?
There is no Leo, how can you say that?
I’ve got a solution.
Get out.
Who are you?
Oh, God! Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.
Sheldon?
Yeah, I got it, Sheldon, why?
Oh…!
Well, that’s Leo. Hey, um, why don’t you tell me
about your showcase last night?
There were only two people there?
As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly, let’s
give them some privacy.
Sounds good.
Gee, why wouldn’t I?
Yeah! Funny how things work out.
How long is he going to stay here.
O-o-o-o-h! Again?
Just reset the board.
Hey!
Yeah, right here. How was Nebraska?
How was your family?
Here we go.
Sheldon, relax, she doesn’t have any symptoms, I’m sure she’s
not contagious.
Penny, you’ll have to excuse Sheldon, he’s a bit of
a germophobe.
You’d better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol.
No problem. Welcome home.
What the hell are you doing?
With lime jello?
I don’t think so.
Sheldon, you are not sick. This is, but you are
not.
Sheldon, don’t you think you’re overreacting?
I’m going back to bed.
What for?
I mix pancake batter in this!
You had time to make a label for everything in
this apartment, including the label maker, but you didn’t have
ten seconds to make one that said urine cup?
Huh. I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a
letter of apology.
Hey.
I’m at work.
Yes.
Yes.
They asked me to come in.
They texted me.
No kidding?
Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids.
Drink whatever you want.
Then make soup.
I’m at work, Sheldon.
Yes,
Yes, they’re training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when
they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists,
I have to go.
Howard, it’s Leonard, code Milky Green.
Affirmative, with fever.
Howard, listen to me.
No, don’t, don’t….
I tried to stop you.
You call Koothrappali, we need to find a place to
lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours.
Five movies, two hours apiece. It’s a start.
Oh, hi Penny!
I’m… uh… at work.
I’m… uh… in a… I’m in a radiation suit. What’s
up?
Sheldon’s at the Cheesecake Factory. Just tell him to go
home.
He’s paranoid, and he’s established a nest.
Uh, yeah, I’d be… I’d be happy to Penny. Oh
my God there’s a breech in the radiation unit. The
whole city is in jeopardy, oh my God, Professor Googenfeil
is melting, gotta go, bye! I feel really guilty.
Oh dammit, my glasses. Okay, I’m blind here guys, can
you help me find them?
Oh great.
Yeah, at home.
Hi, Penny. I was wondering, is Sheldon still at the
restaurant? Okay, that was very nice of you. Okay, gotta
go, got kind of a full blown Chernobyl thing here,
gotta go, bye. He’s home, I’m screwed. Ten and a
half hours of apey blurriness.
You want me to get eye surgery?
I’m thinking!
What do you see, what do you see.
Okay, he must be in his bedroom. My spare glasses
are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my
Bat-signal.
Raj?
Well I can’t do it, I can’t see anything.
Fine.
Won’t my footsteps set it off?
Well, how do I carry it if I’m on my
hands and knees?
What?
Then just say go straight.
Alright. I just hit my head.
It wasn’t on?
Then why did I have to crawl?
Okay, it’s on.
I know.
Hi!
Well, I had to, you see what he’s like.
No!
W-wait!
Wait! Penny! Take me with you!
I don’t think Penny’s ever coming here again.
Yeah, so?
If I stand, I’ll vomit.
Lay it on me.
How about that.
Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement
on the old Sheldon?
That is a problem.
Dr Gablehouser.
Graduate work, very impressive.
Advantage Kim.
Yes sir.
A bad feeling I have about this, mmm-hmmm.
So, Dennis, how long have you been in America.
No kidding, you speak English really well.
What are you talking about?
Come on, Sheldon, we’ve hardly shown him anything.
Huh, yeah?
Come on, Dennis, I’ll show you the rec centre, they’ve
got nautilus equipment.
Not heavy ones.
Come on, Dennis, I’ll show you the radiation lab.
It’s like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isn’t it?
Something you’d like to share? A tale of woe perhaps.
Just eat, Sheldon, you’ll feel better.
You can’t let this kid get to you. You always
knew that someday someone would come along who was younger
and smarter.
Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?
Hey.
Great.
Great.
Great.
Okay, well, right now I’m designing an experiment to study
the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but I
really don’t need any help.
Yes.
It would blow up.
Pretty sure.
Okay, Sheldon, I understand that you’re going through a bit
of a career crisis, you’re searching for some other area
where you can feel valuable and productive but I need
to tell you something and I want you to listen
carefully.
Go away.
If he were, I wouldn’t be.
Is that even possible?
Like what? He’ll never be able to cope with the
fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more
accomplished than he is.
Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim? I’m
not saying no.
That won’t happen, he’s not interested in anything but physics.
What?
Howard, he’s fifteen.
Howard, that’s racist, any fifteen year-old girl will do the
trick.
It’s take your daughter to work day.
Okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in
a room full of attractive age-appropriate women.
Does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?
Like what? We can’t get fifteen year-old girls drunk.
No, we can’t.
Okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a
girl, and figure out how to get her together with
Dennis.
Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years
doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor
with non-fat White Russians, while you’re the one holding her
head out of the toilet while she’s puking and telling
you she wishes more guys were like you, and they
she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for
her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend
and she acts like she doesn’t even know you.
I think that’s our girl. One of us should go
talk to her.
I can’t just go up and talk to her. Howard,
you talk to her.
Well, we’re not in India.
Okay, that was uncalled for.
The kid got a girl.
Yeah, mission accomplished.
Well, why do we go home alone every night, we’re
still smart.
I don’t know if the ticket was so much for
the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman
“you have to frisk me, I have a rocket in
my pants.”
Yeah, we really ruined his life.
Still, I’d like to know the details. His mother was
human, his father was Vulcan, they couldn’t just conceive.
What did you spill on it?
I’ll take a look at it.
You’re kidding, why not?
This is our year! With those guys out, the entire
physics bowl will kneel before Zod.
Come on, you need a four person team, we’re four
people.
Sheldon, what, do I need to quote Spock’s dying words
to you.
The needs of the many.
The ladies?
Let’s put it to a vote. All those in favour….
Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield
for a question?
After we go through the exercise of an annoying series
of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does
he then intend to threaten to quit if he does
not get his way?
I move we are the Army Ants, all those in
favour?
Yes.
Oh, uh, he’ll be okay once the women are mixed
into the crowd. He only has a problem when they’re
one on one and smell nice.
I was actually the one who noticed, okay, let’s just
start.
I knew that too.
Just ask another one.
Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer.
Howard, sit down.
maybe we should take a little break.
Can it wait, I need to talk to you.
Why do they say AA?
Isn’t that confusing? AA might mean something else to certain
people.
No, I meant…. never mind. Hey, check it out. I
got you a Batman cookie jar!
Well, you’re a friend, and you like Batman, and cookies,
and you’re off the team.
Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting.
Yes we did, I just came from it.
Okay, let me try it this way, uh, I was
at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and
one thing led to another and it turns out you’re
off the team.
Because you’re taking all the fun out of it.
Okay, let me try it this way, you’re annoying and
no-one wants to play with you any more.
Thanks for the heads up.
Yes.
He won’t say. He just smiles, and eats macaroons out
of his bat jar.
How exactly would that laugh go?
Guys, let’s remember that Sheldon is still our friend and
my room mate.
So nothing, let’s destroy him.
Raj, we’re not getting TV’s Blossom to join our physics
bowl team.
We can’t ask Leslie Winkle.
Yes.
Fine. Here I go, taking one for the team. In
the sack. Hey Leslie.
Leslie, I have a question for you, and it might
be a little awkward, you know, given that I…
There’s not? Gee, cos it sure sounds like there should
be.
That’s all very comforting, but if it’s okay, I’d like
to get on with my question now.
We are entering the physics bowl and we need a
fourth for our team.
She’s in.
Oh, yeah. You know you don’t have to stay for
the whole thing.
Sheldon.
So, is that your team.
Here’s your tee-shirt.
No, it stands for Perpetual Motion Squad.
The Eta Meson.
Prevost’s theory of exchanges.
What the hell is that.
Come on, think, Leslie.
You’re never going to let that go, are you?
Sorry, I panicked.
Um, eight. Point four.
Hang on. Sheldon, is proving that you are single-handedly smarter
than everyone else so important that you would rather lose
by yourself than win as part of a team.
Go ahead.
Sorry, somebody’s sitting there.
My Physics Bowl Trophy!
I know someone who would disagree.
My Physics Bowl Trophy! “Leonard is so smart, Sheldon who?”
You’re right, I’m sorry. I’m not!
What are you doing?
Bring it on.
How do you know these things?
Wait, I don’t think it’s Shatner.
I don’t believe it.
Some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop
from the original film and no-one is bidding on it.
No, a time machine from Sophie’s Choice.
Uh-huh.
Yeah. And that’s my bid.
It was a spur of the moment thing, I figured
it would go for thousands and I just wanted to
be a part of it.
Not to blow on a miniature time machine.
Come on, snipers.
Where are your snipers?
Snipe.
Snipe.
Snipe!
SNIPE!
Aaaa-aw!
Yeah, I know, I still can’t afford it.
I just assumed. Who sells a full sized time machine
for $800?
How are we going to get it upstairs?
Yes but the elevator’s been broken for two years.
Come on, guys, push.
Uh, hi Penny. Take a break, guys!
Oh, just, you know, moving… something upstairs.
It’s… you know, time machine.
Uh, just give us a few minutes.
Hey, if you wait for us to set up the
time machine, I can drop you off at work yesterday.
Time travel joke, it’s not… never mind.
Let’s just do this. Guys, ready to push?
Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing I have
ever owned.
Seconded.
That sounds fair.
Sheldon, you can’t be selfish, we all paid for it,
so it belongs to all of us. Now out of
the way so I can sit in my time machine.
Okay, I am setting the dials for March 10 th,
1876.
So, when it’s your turn you can.
Okay, I am setting the dials for January 10 th,
2328. Here we go into the future. That was fun.
Are you okay?
That doesn’t sound too bad.
Sorry.
The lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try
it?
So?
Because I want to go back and keep myself from
getting a time machine.
Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that
to me?
What if I knocked you unconscious right now?
But it would make the present so much nicer.
What was your first clue?
Yes I’m upset.
Yeah, good for you.
I don’t know. Maybe.
Uh, here’s the thing. Girls like Penny never end up
with guys who own time machines.
Thanks for pointing it out.
Those are movies.
Come on, guys, push.
Uh, hi Penny. Take a break, guys!
Oh, just, you know, moving a… time machine.
No problem. Hang on.
Some things are more important than toys.
Don’t worry baby, I’ve got you.
I’m packing up all my collectibles and taking them down
to the comic book store to sell.
It’s not about money.
Terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the
time machine?
Because I don’t want it any more.
Just… personal reasons.
Look, do you want to buy me out or not?
I paid two hundred dollars for my share.
No, no more toys or action figures or props or
replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers,
I’m getting rid of all of it.
Not for long.
It’s not a bidding war, I’m selling it all to
Larry down at the comic book store.
He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.
Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you,
the other two are going to be really mad at
me.
Sorry Raj, my mind is made up.
Sheldon, get out of my way.
Okay. I did not want to do this but, I
have here the rare mint condition production error Star Trek
No, I needed to hear it.
Still, I think it’s time for me to get rid
of this stuff and… you know… move on with my
life.
Yeah.
Thanks. Hey, do you want to, I don’t know, later…
My turn on the time machine.
Sheldon, are you okay?
It is a little big for the living room, isn’t
it?
I’m glad you agree. I hired some guys to help
us move it, come on in fellas.
On the other hand, some physicists are concerned that if
the super collider actually works, it will create a black
hole and swallow up the Earth ending life as we
know it.
Hey, check it out, the school of pharmacology is looking
for volunteers.
I don’t know, Raj. Maybe the comic book store doesn’t
have a bulletin board. What’s going on?
Sheldon’s office? Is she lost?
Maybe she’s his lawyer.
Howard…
Oh, hey buddy.
Sheldon, are you going to introduce us?
You too, swell, also.
So, how do you two know each other.
Excuse me?
So Missy, what brings you all the way from Texas?
Woah, woah.
If the wedding’s not until tomorrow, why don’t you stay
with us tonight?
Look, you’re here, we have plenty of room.
So it’s settled. You’ll stay with us.
Hee-hee, just classic.
Those are not mine.
Yeah, no, I do, I use those… uh… just to
polish up my… spear-fishing equipment. I spear fish. When I’m
not crossbow hunting, I spear fish. Uh, Penny, this is
Sheldon’s twin sister, Missy. Missy, this is our neighbour Penny.
I wasn’t staring!
Oh. Huh, um, maybe, if you like women who are
tall… and perfect.
I brought snacks.
Onion dip, it’s onion dip.
We don’t entertain much.
Bye Missy, see you.
Uh, yeah, no, uh, bye Penny.
Excuse me, this is my apartment and she’s my roommate’s
sister.
How do I have Penny? In what universe do I
have Penny?
Hell, no!
Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?
Thank you.
Sheldon, are you aware that your sister is an incredibly
attractive woman?
That’s fascinating, but I…
Alright, noted. But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz…
they’re hitting on your sister.
That’s great, but I….
Whatever. You have to do something about it.
Because she’s your sister.
Okay, uh…. oh, consider this. With your father gone, it
is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a
suitable mate.
Uh-huh.
Exactly. And, you owe it to yourself and to posterity
to protect the genetic integrity of your sister’s future offspring.
He’s the man of his family, you have to respect
his wishes.
Say what?
We all make mistakes, let’s move on.
Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable.
We all make mistakes, let’s move on.
I agree. Sheldon’s sister is hiding at Penny’s because we’ve
all been hitting on her at the same time.
Sit down.
If we’re going to fight over Missy, let’s do it
the right way. The honourable way.
And he’s down!
Stay down, bitch. Yeah, ha ha, natural selection at work.
Excuse me while I go tell Missy the good news.
Hi Penny, how’s it going. Listen, that guy Mike that
you were dating, is that still going on?
Nothing, just catching up. By the way, may I speak
to Missy please?
Well, since you’re leaving tomorrow I was wondering if you’d
like to go out to dinner with me?
Oh. You have other plans, or…?
Oh. Alright uh… enjoy the rest of your evening.
Um, here’s something we didn’t anticipate.
Oh, it’s called trestling.
Forget about the cake, how did you know that my
birthday is Saturday?
Oh, I don’t think so.
I don’t celebrate my birthday.
No, it’s no big deal, it’s just the way I
was raised. My parents focussed on celebrating achievements, and being
expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of
them.
Thank you.
No. But it was okay. I mean, when I was
little I’d think maybe my parents would change their mind,
and surprise me with a party, like this one birthday
I came home from my Cello lesson, and I saw
a lot of strange cars parked out front, and when
I got to the door I could hear people whispering,
and I could smell German chocolate cake, which is my
favourite.
Uh, it turns out my grandfather had died.
Oh, it was kind of like a birthday party. I
got to see all my cousins and there was cake,
so…7
Howard, every Thai restaurant in town knows you can’t eat
peanuts. They see me coming they go “ah, no peanut
boy!”
Hey.
Fine.
Seen it.
Oh. Pass.
Look, I am in the Halo battle of my life
here, there’s this kid in Copenhagen, he has no immune
system so all he does is sit in his bubble
and play Halo 24/7.
Not if you believe his doctors.
No.
Here you go, Copenhagen boy, how about a taste of
Hans Christian Hand Grenade. Come on, come on, oh you
clever little…. Come on, come on, take that!
What’s the matter?
Oh my God, why did you eat it?
Well if I had a gun there, would you have
shot yourself?
Now?
Alright, um, just, uh, let me get my keys.
Alright, let’s go.
Hey, sorry I couldn’t find a parking spot, how are
you doing.
Really, ‘cos you don’t look like you’re swelling up at
all, maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at
the drug store and go home.
Why not?
Alright, I’ll be right back.
Excuse me, my friend is having an allergic reaction to
peanuts.
Yes he is.
Say what you will about the healthcare system in this
country, but when they’re afraid of lawsuits they sure test
everything.
You know, before you got all swollen up, I actually
thought you were trying to keep me out of the
apartment so you could throw me a surprise party.
There is a party, isn’t there.
Howard.
how could I be mad? You actually risked your life
because you cared about me.
Alright. Here we go. My first birthday party.
Oh, it’s okay.
Hey Penny, when, uh, when’s your birthday?
Hey!
Why are you learning Chinese?
If I were you, I’d be more concerned by what
they’re passing off as chicken.
Oh, yeah, no, sure, go ahead.
What’s going on?
Penny, are you okay?
Look, I understand that breaking up with someone can be
very painful….
Okay, feel better, bye. She doesn’t want to talk.
It was Penny’s boyfriend’s, they broke up.
You know what, I’m going to go back and try
talking to her again.
I’m not going to do that, Howard.
What about “damsel in distress?”
I don’t care. She’s upset, I’m going over there.
I’m her friend, I’m not going to take advantage of
her vulnerability.
I said I’m her friend. Not her gay friend.
Hey, listen, I know you said that you didn’t want
to talk…
Sorry.
Wait, did you say wait?
No. No.
Of course not.
I’m sorry, what were the choices again?
Yeah, no, sure.
Actually it’s not all that easy to find.
Okay, well, what exactly did this guy write, not that
I need to know the details of your sex life,
I just thought…. never mind.
Okay, well, you know, this isn’t that bad. It just
paints the picture of a very affectionate woman who’s open
to expressing her affection in non traditional locales.
Elevators, parks, movie theatres, out of curiosity, is this subway
the transportation system or subway the sandwich shop?
Doesn’t that violate the health code?
Huh. Okay. But my point is that you have absolutely
no reason to be embarrassed.
Maybe a little.
No. No, no, that, that would be underreacting. He did
break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom and, in your
case, the elevator, parks and fast food franchise.
Yes, you should, go ahead, say it.
What is there to explain, it’s all right here, it’s
a betrayal.
I’m pretty sure I never said that.
Aw, good for me. Where are you going?
Oh, sure. Huh, maybe I am her gay friend.
Can we please change the subject.
Just roll the dice.
She was mad at him. She was done with him,
the relationship was broken beyond repair and I walked over
there and I fixed it!
Just eat your tangerine chicken.
I’m back.
What happened?
Yeah, I know, I know that part.
Already, that was quick.
Oh, Penny, I am so sorry.
Oh, well, you know, you did throw an 8 gig
iPod… yeah, no, how could he do that.
Yeah, that must get old quick.
What about me?
What about if you went out with me?
Um… yes… I am… asking you out.
I was just going off your comment about the nice
guy…
…thing and honest but, it’s no big deal…
Yes what?
Really?
Yeah. That’s the spirit.
Two seats right there.
Sheldon, I think I’ve made a mistake.
No, it’s about Penny.
I don’t think I can go out with her tonight.
Other people would say “why not?”
I’m going to talk anyway.
Now that I’m actually about to go out with Penny,
I’m not excited, I’m nauseous.
Right.
Sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with Penny,
what happens if I blow it.
You’re not helping.
Tell me whether or not to go through with the
date.
Wow, that’s brilliant.
Hi.
Thank you. You look very nice.
I made an eight o’clock reservation.
Oh. Okay. But before you say anything, have you ever
heard of Schrodinger’s Cat?
Good.
