Hey, this is my natural hair colour. Now. So, does
Sheldon have anything special planned for you tomorrow night?
That’s hot. You kids better use protection.
Just a couple of minutes. You’ve really never done this
before?
Oh, my gosh, that’s awful. The other kids make fun
of you?
Uh, I don’t know, it’s still kind of weird. We
haven’t really recovered since he proposed to me in the
middle of sex.
This is great. What’s the occasion?
That is so sweet.
Go Sports?
This is awesome. I love it!
Gosh, I worked my ass off today. This is exactly
what I needed.
Ah, thank you!
Oh, come on. I just told you I had a
hard day.
Great.
Sweetie, can I just be the girl tonight?
Thank you.
No, we don’t! Come on in!
Yeah, it’s fun, isn’t it?
All right, who’s ready for another beer?
Girls.
Okay, hold on…
That’s enough.
Raj.
Ooh, one gravy boat.
One inappropriate, yet I wish I thought of that gravy
boat.
Ew, why?
What about me what?
Oh, well, you know, Leonard is great.
He’s a sweetie.
Yeah, sure, of course I love him.
Well, I do.
No, he’d just take it the wrong way.
It means he is special and smart and nice and…
No. Maybe. I don’t know.
That’s the thing, I’m not. I’m not unhappy at all.
It’s just, I don’t know, I, I’ve been in love
before, but it felt different. But maybe this is a
new, better, boring kind of love. Do you ever feel
that way about Howard?
Amy, you?
Oh, my God. Sheldon?
What are you doing in my bedroom?
How did you even get in, you weirdo?
What do you want, Sheldon?
Talk about what?
Sheldon.
Okay, go home, crazy man.
Okay, what did Amy tell you?
Okay, you listen to me. I think it’s really sweet
you’re trying to protect your friend, but this is none
of your business. Got it?
Of course not.
Worst bedtime story ever.
Okay, honey, I have a lot to figure out, and
until I do, you are not to say a word
to Leonard. Do you understand?
Get out.
What?
That is the last thing I want to do.
Get out.
What the hell is wrong with you? You told Sheldon?
Do you know what a terrible position this puts me
in?
Really?
Mmm.
Uh-huh.
Look, there’s something I need to tell you.
I don’t really know how to say this.
Okay. Here goes.
I didn’t know what else to do. He had those
big, sad eyes.
He looked at me like this.
Look, it’s fine. We’re not getting married, okay? We’re keeping
things, you know, homeostasis.
It’s from Leonard. Last night was amazing. You’re amazing. I’m
so lucky to have you in my life. Okay, stop
it.
Ugh. Hey, Sheldon? Hi. This came for you today. It’s
from your mom.
M-hmm.
Oh, boy, a whole dollar. Now, I can quit my
paper route. So, what’s in it?
Aw, how cute. Is this like a diary?
Really, your potty training journal?
August 7, 8
Oh, disgusting.
Why do you need all this stuff?
Sorry!
Of course, it is, it’s been in the news. And
it’s a very famous boson.
Yeah, that’s basically what I said.
You really think there’s some kind of scientific discovery in
here?
Maybe I could do it.
A proof that algebraic topology can never have a non
self-contradictory set of abelion groups. I’m just a blonde monkey
to you, aren’t I?
Okay, for the final touch, this is an eyelash curler.
You just place it on your lashes and squeeze it
closed.
Who I hope for her sake is not Captain Hook,
so… who are you calling?
What?
Maybe he didn’t notice.
No, you do not.
Oh, Amy, really? She is not going to come on
to Sheldon.
Well, for starters, at some point, that face starts talking.
Amy, this is crazy. You have nothing to be suspicious
about.
Can we go now?
What are you doing?
Come on, Amy. That is not gonna work.
There’s nothing to be brave about. Everything’s fine.
Okay, maybe she was flirting with him, but who cares?
Look, I don’t even know where my relationship is with
Leonard is right now.
Well, of course he’s desirable. I mean, he’s great. He’s
smart, he’s sweet, and, ooh, in the bedroom, whew, let
me tell you, he really tries.
Fine, it bothers me a little. No. You know what?
This is stupid. It doesn’t bother me. Okay, it bothers
me. But only because she wouldn’t stop laughing. Leonard is
not that funny.
So, how was work today?
Oh! You’re kidding.
Wow. Anything else?
Oh, is that it?
Oh, it’s about time. I hated the old way. Hi.
I’m Penny.
In a way. We’ve kind of been involved in a
five-year experiment.
Well, a lot of people can’t. Uh, hey.
My limbic system wants to take your pants off.
You’re unbelievable.
How about boys versus girls?
Once again, unbelievable.
All right, round one. Here.
Okay. Ready, set, go.
Present! Yeah!
Oh, my God, we’re gonna kill them.
It’s a chocolate chip cookie.
Relax, we got time, this is so fun.
Soon.
All right, that’s enough.
Yep!
Excuse me, the word is polish. See? Small P.
Hey, Sheldon, you’re always full of fun little facts. Where
did the expression got your ass handed to you come
from?
I wonder if it’s from, like, ancient Rome where they’d
actually chop somebody’s ass off and then go, here. You
know, to appease Loseroneous, the god of losers.
All right, fine, pick another game. Amy and I will
beat you at anything.
Oh, come on, what is that?
No, no, we’re not playing some dumb made-up game.
Why not?
Okay. Just for the record, I have never entered a
wet T-shirt contest. I’ve won a few, but that’s just
because I spill when I’m drunk, so…
I don’t think so.
Okay, glasses off. Find Waldo.
Yes, we win again.
37.
Mwah!
Mwah!
All right, standard state fair pie-eating contest rules are, no
hands, first one to clean the pan wins.
Not now!
I hope so.
It’s not getting any better. Ugh. It’s Leonard. He wants
to go costume shopping later.
I do, it’s just he wants to go to that
party at the comic book store. A lot of the
guys that hang out there are kind of creepy.
I’m, I’m sorry, Amy. You were saying something about Howard’s
foreskin?
Yeah, I’m gonna go. It’s just not my idea of
a good time.
Well, yeah, he’s my boyfriend. Isn’t that, like, his job?
Letting him make me happy.
I guess I could probably try a little harder.
Yeah, that’s kind of a problem.
Not really clear on what he does.
Yeah, I’m not really clear on what that means.
Yeah, you’re really just making it worse.
Anybody home?
I just thought I’d stop by and say hello.
No, I know. It’s long overdue. So, what ya doing?
Better not be building a robot girlfriend.
You’re kidding.
Ooh! What’s going on in here?
What, is it secret?
Oh. You might want to put a sign on it.
Ah. Danger. Sure, sure. Yeah. What’s, what’s that?
Wow. High-techie-techie. What’s this little box?
Ooh, low-techie-techie. So, what are you working on right now?
Yeah?
Sharp. Thanks to the machine we saw earlier.
Wow. That is amazing.
What do you mean? Oh! Wow!
Hmm.
Sometimes I forget how smart you are.
Take off your clothes.
Yeah. You got a problem with that?
Really? Never?
Whoa! That’s heavy.
No. Why?
Whoa! That is very cool.
Getting a little less cool, Leonard.
There we go.
Oh, my God, you guys look adorable.
No, sexy cop. Slutty cop only came with a skirt
and two badges.
I thought we said in the car, no accents?
Nothing to see here. Just sexy police business.
Oh, I’ll get that.
No, no, it’s…
No, it’s not a big deal. Just taking a class
at the Pasadena Community College.
It’s just one history class. Look, I didn’t finish college,
so I thought I would give it a try.
No, I’m not embarrassed. I just didn’t want anyone to
know because I haven’t told Leonard yet.
Because it’s me going back to school, and he’s gonna
be all “you can do it,” and “how can I
help?” and “I’m so proud of you.” Ugh!
Really? You can’t think of anyone weirder?
Spaghetti okay?
Yeah, I don’t think the water was really boiling.
Okay, listen, there’s something I need to tell you. I’ve
been thinking about going back to school for a while
now. So a couple months ago, I started taking a
history class at the community college.
I don’t want you to make a big deal out
of it.
You’re making it a big deal.
Anyway, that’s it. I just thought you should know.
It’s really good. We’ve been talking about the origins of
slavery. Turn in my first paper tomorrow.
Hey hey hey, this is my paper. And my perspective
is that slavery is bad. Oh, and my professor’s black,
so I’m pretty sure that’s the right answer.
No, Leonard, this is my thing.
Thank you.
Thank you. Now behave yourself and eat your dinner. Maybe
later, if you’re lucky, you get to sleep with a
college girl.
Leonard. It’s eight a.m. It’s like the middle of the
night.
Oh, wow, that’s so sweet. Hey, what’s this?
Elves? Come on, Leonard. It’s too early for Lord of
the Rings.
Okay. An examination of the economic, cultural, and political roots
of slavery in the Old South, 1619 to 1865. What
the hell is this?
So let me get this straight. You just assumed my
paper would be bad so you wrote one for me?
What?
You changed every word.
You are such an ass. This is exactly why I
didn’t want to tell you I was taking a class
in the first place.
Right, because me being in school is so important to
you. That way, you wouldn’t have to be dating someone
who’s only a waitress.
Do I? Listen to me. I need to do this
on my own. If I fail, I fail. If I
pass, I pass. Do you get it?
Yeah, well, next time don’t. Oh, and since you like
stories so much, this is not The Shoemaker and the
Elves, okay? This is, Give a man a fish, he
eats it. Teach a man to fish, he, sells it
or something. Whatever, I don’t know, it’s just a lot
better than what you did, you big jerk!
Nope. I have no reason to… “B” mad at you.
Minus.
That’s right. On my paper. Not yours, mine, you punk-ass
elf.
Hmm, how about, gee, Penny, you’re smarter than I thought.
You may be the one in school, but I’m the
one who learned a lesson. I’m so stupid, Penny. Duh.
I don’t think he’ll be making that mistake again.
So, I know this goes without saying, but if either
of you tell Leonard you helped me rewrite this paper,
I will beat you both with a bag of oranges.
Now, ladies, we got a B-minus on this paper. I
think if we put our heads together, on the next
one we could get an A.
Believable? You saying I’m not smart?
That’s better.
Hey. Sorry this took so long. But you used to
work here, you know how it is.
No, I’m a terrible waitress, remember?
Yeah, right.
I’ve seen her burp you.
Yeah, but I told you, I’m not good at my
job. Bernadette, listen to me. He is never gonna leave.
Wow, excuse me.
Hey. What brings you in?
I had a feeling we’d have a talk like this
sooner or later. Are you finally getting fuzz in weird
places?
And for the record, bleugh. So what are you drinking?
You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.
It’s calmed the pants off me a couple of times.
Oh. So, the heart you got from the wizard giving
you trouble?
Yeah, Amy told me what happened. Look, just apologize. It’ll
warm her twaddle.
Honey, you can’t make people like each other.
You might want to pace yourself.
Far be it from me to criticize a man with
a full pubis. Look, Sheldon, your problem is not Wil
Wheaton, okay? Your problem is the way you treated Amy.
Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let
him do it. I thought you Texas guys stood up
for your womenfolk.
Sorry.
Welcome to Long Island, Tex.
Yeah, that she is. Here you go.
No, she won’t.
So, how was work today?
That sounds like fun.
Oh, good, I guessed right.
Oh, just this guy I met at school.
Relax. He’s just a friend. We’re doing an oral report
together. He’s really nice.
Would you stop? Look, he just moved here from London,
okay? He doesn’t really know anybody.
No. That’s not true. There’s French, there’s Italian. No, you’re
right, it’s the best.
It didn’t come up.
What am I supposed to say?
Fine. Hanging with my boyfriend. Talk to you later. Happy?
Mm-hmm. Hmm.
Nothing.
Did your boyfriend make you type that?
Don’t be like that.
No, he’s not. We’re just friends. Look, is this gonna
be a problem? Because he’s supposed to come over tomorrow
to work.
If it makes you uncomfortable, I’ll switch partners, even though
the thing’s due next week and everyone already has a
partner and I’ll probably end up failing the class.
Thanks, Cole. See you at school.
Hey, shouldn’t you be out with your gang, spray painting
equations on the side of buildings?
I just can’t believe you don’t trust me.
Then why did you embarrass me in front of my
friend, who, by the way, knew exactly who you were?
Your picture’s on my refrigerator.
What is your problem? Do you use up all your
thinking at work and then have none left over for
when you get home?
Leonard, why do you always do this? Listen to me,
you’re the one I’m with. You know I love you,
so will you please relax because you’re driving me crazy.
Yeah.
That’s exactly what we’re gonna do because you’re about to
make me cry, and we both know if I start
crying, you’re gonna start crying.
All right.
Yeah. So, how you doing?
Uh, no, they usually don’t have to go out and
get more wax.
Hey, anybody want a drink?
I’m assuming these are some kind of horns they bought
at Comic-Con?
Okay, maybe we should change the subject. Um, Amy, how
are your lady parts? Still chilly down there?
You know, I remember the first time I got a
bikini wax. My sister did it with melted Crayolas and
duct tape. It’s a bad idea.
Damn.
Anyway, to this day, I still can’t see a box
of crayons without crossing my legs.
Okay, Howard’s mother is in, like, every one of your
wedding photos.
No, Leonard’s taking me to a physics lecture, and coffee’ll
just keep me awake. Oh, I’ll get it.
Ow! Ow!
You idiot, what the hell do you have in there?!
Get away from me or I swear to God I
will rip out what’s left of your pubes!
Thanks. Ah!
Gee, you think?
Guys, I think I need to go to the emergency
room.
Yeah, everybody’s happy, great.
S’up?
Step one, worms.
Okay, right there, ew is one of the things you’re
not gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law.
It’s right up there with icky and get it away.
Now pick one up.
You’re gonna have to do it when you’re fishing.
What are you waiting for?
Just pick up a worm and put him on this
hook.
Hey, don’t name him. Just jab a hook in his
face.
That’s great. Cheerleading, way to man things up.
Now, let’s assume, by some miracle, you actually catch a
fish. You’re going to have to know how to gut
it. So, what you’re going to do is you’re going
to take your knife, slice him right up the belly.
You want me to stop?
All right. Now, you don’t want to cut too deep
into its guts, or the blood will just squirt all
over your face. Oh, my God. What is with you
guys?
What, never?
Great. Here you go. What you’re going to do is
you’re going to stick your thumb down its throat, grab
the guts and pull.
Oh, look, it’s a female. You can see all the
eggs.
Okay, now holding sides of hearth in position, lower mantelpiece
assembly onto top tabs.
You’re so butch.
Of course you did. Your hands are softer than veal.
Really? That’s how you’re gonna spend your Saturday night?
Oh, you poor thing. Is having a real-life girlfriend who
has sex with you getting in the way of your
board games?
Hey, guys. I don’t mean to interrupt your little game,
but I thought you’d like to see what you’re missing
out on. So, Bernadette? Bernadette’s wearing leopard-print pumps and a
rack-tastic red dress from Forever 21. And there’s Amy, showing
all kinds of ankle. In an outfit I’m assuming is
from Forever 63. And I, myself am wearing a little
number that got me out of two speeding tickets and
jury duty.
See you, boys. We are going drinking.
Come on.
No!
Wow, you should come to girls’ night more often. And
not just because if you weren’t here, this would be
a can of Pabst.
Okay, wait, are we talking one-night stand or do we
want to get him into a relationship?
Raj, you’re a great guy, you’re in a bar full
of single women, let us help you.
Nines or tens?
Of course he is. Look, that girl just got dumped
by her boyfriend. She’s angry, she’s drunk, and her favorite
movie is Slumdog Millionaire. I mean.
So, how’d it go?
Ooh!
Oh, honey, it’s not you, it’s them.
Oh, come on, Raj, not even a little bit?
What?
What is happening?
You’re talking about Leonard.
Wait, what the hell’s going on with Leonard and Alex?
Fine. Ricardo and Tondelaya.
I’m gonna kill her.
We know what’s going on, Sheldon!
What? He’s loving it?
Oh, you seem extra happy.
Any particular reason why?
Mm-hmm. Anything else?
That’s great.
Hmm. Well, I’m glad you’re having such a great day.
Oh, and who’s that?
Oh, I just didn’t know if you meant me or
Alex.
Because I know she hit on you and I know
you liked it.
Don’t play dumb with me, Ricardo Shilly-Shally!
Oh, damn it, you are.
I don’t care about Alex. Fine, I care. Okay, I
hate that bitch. But what really hurt is that you
liked it so much. I mean, do I need to
be worried?
Because, she is pretty and smart, and when you talk
about work, she doesn’t have to go home and look
up words in the dictionary to understand what you said.
No.
Yes, Leonard, I am insecure. Happy?
Why are you smiling?
Well, I do.
Good.
What’s that?
Can I tell you a secret?
Keep talking about Captain Kirk, and we’re all gonna stop.
What did you do?
So, hey, I was thinking about that stuff with Alex.
I can’t help it. But, look, I figured I could
sit around and feel insecure, or I could do something
about it. So I got a course catalogue at school
and looked at some of the science classes.
No, it isn’t, they are extremely boring. I mean, how
do you not kill yourself, like, every day? Anyway, I
decided I don’t need to be a scientist, I could
just look like one. So I bought these.
I know, right? Watch this. Molecules.
Where are we going?
Hi. Here are the make-up sponges you asked for.
Damn, you’ve got more makeup than I do. You’ve got
better makeup than I do. Yeah, I’m borrowing this.
I feel like you guys just went to Comic-Con.
Is that better?
Well, then why are you going?
All right. Well, you guys have fun. I guess I’ll
see you Sunday night.
Okay.
What was that for?
Oh, this is the best. You have booze with breakfast
on a Tuesday, you got a problem. You do it
on the weekend, you got brunch.
Oh. It’s Leonard. He says they’re on the road and
headed for Bakersfield at warp speed. Maybe it’s the mimosa,
but I’m gonna give the kid an LOL.
I know. The four of them work at a major
university. They’re all super smart. How can they still be
into something made for 12-year-olds?
Mmmm. Now I feel bad for picking on all those
kids. Although, in my defence, if Danny Biffle didn’t want
to eat a mouthful of dirt, he shouldn’t have shown
up to school wearing a bow tie.
Uh-uh.
That is an amazing idea. Okay, how many of these
have I had?
Hey, Stuart.
No, we were just wondering why the guys like this
stuff so much, so we thought we’d give it a
try.
Well then, what do you recommend?
As evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters.
Ooh, Thor! He’s hot.
Hmm, okay, I’m done. How did you guys finish so
fast?
Yeah, well, I have street smarts.
Mmm.
Stupid?
I don’t know how Leonard can get so caught up
in this.
I know. A hammer so heavy that no one else
can pick it up?
That makes even less sense, I mean…
Okay, hang on, what if Thor’s hand is on the
hammer? I mean, if he’s touching it with his god
magic, does that mean I could lift it?
Well, which is it?
Okay.
Wait, I thought we were reading.
Yes!
You said it’s a magic hammer.
If Harry Potter’s wand can make decisions, why can’t Thor’s
hammer?
Oh, yeah? Then how does the sun come up every
day?
Oh, great. Yes. And then you will see, I am
not wrong, because if we were in outer space, then
anyone could pick up the hammer because it would be
floating around in a weightless environment. Yeah, that’s right, the
slow reader used science. Suck on that.
Okay, hang on. If I go to a bar and
pick up a guy, and he picks up a girl,
and then we all leave together, did I pick up
the girl?
Hey, are we talking about me or are we talking
about Thor?
No, it’s because they’re in space. He’s really just touching
the strap.
How could Red Hulk be worthy?
It’s hot when Sheldon talks dirty.
Yeah, if that’s your idea of what’s cool, you should
get one.
Honey, if you want one, just get one.
I hate it when you make me sit through all
the credits.
Yeah, but I don’t think that’s going to happen in
a documentary about the Holocaust.
What is that?
Well, wait, if he’s unhappy,shouldn’t we talk to him?
You doing okay, sweetie?
What beverage do you make for that?
All right, I don’t understand. Why didn’t you just tell
Kripke the truth?
That is what I write on the bathroom walls. For
a whimsically inventive time, call Leonard Hofstadter.
Yeah. Sheldon, can I ask you a question?
You ever going to sleep with Amy?
Maybe you don’t, I do. What’s the deal?
All right, come on, be serious. Look, you guys have
been going out a long time. She would clearly like
to have a physical relationship with you, so what are
you doing?
Then what’s the problem?
Okay. Hang on. Are you saying someday you and Amy
might actually get physical?
Oh, my God! Sheldon, I know this wasn’t easy for
you, and I’m really glad we could have this conversation.
Oh, my God!
Yeah, but you two make such a cute couple. Like
Burt and Ernie. You guys even teach me stuff about
words and numbers.
Wow. Where are you going to go?
Oh.
No, not at all. No, it’s, it’s great. It’s terrific.
I, you know, I just can’t help feel bad about
Sheldon. I mean, how’s he going to get by without
you? Ernie.
Yeah, he does, but it’s not the same.
Um, well, um, all right. You, you know how in
Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Ron didn’t abandon Harry
just because Harry started dating Ron’s sister?
Sorry. Spoiler alert. My point is, as much as I
want to live with you, I can’t do it knowing
how much Sheldon needs you.
Well, you know what they say, if it ain’t broke.
No. No, no, I do. I do. It’s just, I
mean, it’s a really big step.
Well, um, I’m just a little thirsty.
I got nothing.
Yeah. Okay, all right, don’t freak out. You can make
this work.
Oh, please let some of it be Xanax.
Hey. What’s going on?
Really? Interesting.
It’s like the happiness won’t ever leave the apartment.
Yes. That is a real thing. And it doesn’t mean
you don’t care about each other, it just means things
are moving at a pace you’re not comfortable with, and
that’s fine.
Well, maybe he doesn’t know how to say it without
hurting her feelings.
That is the worst, isn’t it?
What did I do?
Okay. Listen, the truth is I don’t want him living
with me.
No, I don’t want to break his heart. I love
him. This is just happening too fast.
Yeah, and I’ve seen those legs. You might want to
get some Drano.
Well, you know how he is. He’s sensitive and emotional.
Well, I don’t know what else we can do but
tell them the truth.
Yeah. And who knows how Amy will react.
Hey, Ames.
Sheldon, what did you say?
Oh, don’t get all huffy. You’re the one who decided
to move in without even asking me if I was
ready.
And since you love the truth so much, why don’t
you tell Amy you don’t want to live with her
instead of blaming it on me?
Come on, Amy, let’s go drink wine and talk about
what jerks our boyfriends are.
Um…
You’ll never believe what happened to me at work today.
This old guy was choking on his food, and I
saved his life.
No. I said, oh, my God, I think that old
guy’s choking, and then one of the busboys Heimlich’ed him.
Yeah, that was the point of the story.
Um, I think so. Why?
Oh, right. Yeah, we can do something.
No, I’m into it, I’m into it. Just, there’s so
much pressure to make the night special, and it never
works out.
You know, sometimes I think I’ve made you so much
cooler than you used to be, and then you go
and do that.
This place is really beautiful.
Hey.
No problem. We just sat down.
Is everything okay?
Oh, son of a bitch.
Nothing. Nothing.
It’s just this guy I used to date.
Until he cheated on me with my friend Gretchen, who’s
here with him now.
And it looks like she lost a lot of weight,
damn it.
No, you’re totally right. She could be skinny ’cause she’s
dying.
You know what, screw them. Our night is going to
be way more special than theirs.
What? Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Get up.
Oh, I can’t believe he’s going to marry the girl
he cheated on me with.
What, so I’m the wrong person? Maybe you want to
be with Gretchen, too.
Yes, absolutely. Now they’re doing that phony link-arm-drink thingy. I
totally taught him that.
We were; it’s just, it’s not fair, okay? They’re bad
people. It’s not supposed to end happy for them, it’s
supposed to end happy for me.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Oh, come on, don’t make this about you.
Yeah, well, whatever, okay? I told you, Valentine’s Day sucks.
What?
Night.
Yeah, I know. I’m a total bitch.
Well, I am.
I don’t know. Maybe ’cause things are going so well
between us lately and I’ve been really happy.
Obviously, I have some commitment issues.
As long as things keep going great between us, you’ll
keep asking me to marry you, and eventually I’m gonna
end up saying yes, and then we’re gonna be married
forever, and the whole thing just freaks me out.
What, what do you mean? Are you breaking up with
me?
Really?
Yeah, you got it.
Okay. You know what? This might be the wine talking,
but I have a very important question to ask you.
Leonard Hofstadter?
Will you be my valentine?
Hello.
Yeah, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been
at a party where everyone’s talking about flags and I
just couldn’t join in.
Uh, I’m sorry, can we just pause for a minute?
I just think it might look more natural if you
talked to me instead of the camera, you know, like,
like a real conversation. It’s something we work on in
my acting class.
Yeah, let’s try it again, and maybe, this time, you
could work on your body language a bit. You know,
when you’re all hunched like that, you’re shutting the audience
out, but when you’re relaxed and open, you’re inviting them
in.
Let’s try open.
Um, well, I’m from Nebraska. So what can you tell
me about the state flag?
Oh, hi. What’s up?
You need me to shut the door so you can
do your knocking thing?
Okay. So, what do you need?
Really?
Aw, sweetie, you just made my day.
Hey, my acting class is putting on a play Friday
night. I could put you and Amy on the guest
list.
What?
Hey, I don’t want you to go any more.
You should go ’cause you want to go, not because
you have to.
Okay. Do whatever you want.
Oh, for God’s sake, just come to the play.
You love her very much, don’t you?
I think you have a great capacity for devotion. You’ll
be lonely when she passes on, won’t you? I understand
what that is.
…when I was a very young girl. When I was
16 years old, I made the discovery, love. All at
once, and much, much too completely. It was like you
suddenly turned a blinding light on something that had always
been half a shadow. That’s how it struck the world
for me. But I was unlucky. Deluded.
Are you kidding? You brought fancy wine and made fondue.
I’ve slept with guys for less. It’s a joke. Based
on real events.
Yeah, but you just have to remember, that ride is
shorter than you think and they take a picture of
you at the end, so make sure you got your
clothes back on. It’s a joke. Based on real events.
So, blow off work, go on a weekday.
It’s more like how girls end up at a Best
Western hotel with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.
I can laugh about it now.
I’m in.
Oh, yeah, right. Wait, what was your problem again?
Yeah, that’s a toughie.
I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I said bye.
You’re kidding, right? We’re not just gonna get drunk and
go on rides?
All right, whatever. How does it work?
Guess it would be fun to be Cinderella.
Yeah.
Unless you want to be Cinderella.
I can explain. I played hooky with the girls, then
we all went to Disneyland and got… What are you
doing?
Hi.
Ooh, it smells good.
Sheldon, aren’t you gonna spend a little time with Amy?
What is your point?
Really? You couldn’t just say that? You had to tell
the scrotum story?
It was a nice change of pace not eating takeout
around a coffee table.
Sure. Just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice
clothes, right? Not, like, capes and tights and crap?
No.
What if I ask Sheldon, you just happen to be
in the room?
Okay.
Hey, Sheldon.
No, we just want information.
We heard you read the letter from Howard’s father.
What did it say?
Why do you even care? Just tell us what it
says.
Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadette’s closet.
Doesn’t that count for something?
Yeah, obviously.
Yeah, and the hors d’oeuvres are delightful.
Aw.
Sure.
I know.
We were all thinking it, really. It was kind of
the elephant in the room, so…
Yeah. And I said if it wasn’t epistemic, we might
as well not do it.
It was a letter explaining that your dad wasn’t who
he said he was. Eventually, his other life caught up
to him, and the only way to keep you and
your mom safe was to leave.
Hey, it’s still early. Why don’t we go back and
have that party?
This turned out pretty well, huh?
Damn, I forgot to feed him. And that I had
him.
Party’s over! Party’s over!
So tenured means a job for life?
You can’t get fired even if you’re bad at it?
Wow, sounds a lot like being a pretty waitress at
the Cheesecake Factory.
She’d be proud, huh?
So, who do you have to schmooze to get this
deal?
That’s great. That shows a lot of integrity.
Oh, good, you heard me.
Oh, not really. I was out shopping with Amy. She
wanted me to help her find something for this memorial
thing.
Oh, what a jerk.
Well, since Amy’s going, do you want me there? You
know, to support you?
Okay. I’m just gonna tie my shoe while you think
about that.
Oh, then you all can get tenure.
I’m here to support my man, just like you.
No.
Absolutely not. Help me out here, I can’t afford another
demerit.
Well, hang on. Maybe the Chinese haven’t finished watching it
yet.
Uh, Sheldon, there are two dumplings left. Do you want
them?
As a rule, no.
Well, why don’t you make up your own ending?
I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call.
It’s six thirty in the morning.
It was cute.
What’s wrong with cute?
So you want me to stop calling your little tushy
cute?
I liked it. I’m excited.
What do you want from me?
Oh, come on, don’t be like that.
I’m sorry I called it cute. Let’s watch another one.
Yeah, it was fun. Kind of reminded me of my
high school. But instead of vampires, we had meth heads.
But both came out at night and had messed up
teeth.
Oh. Well, that’s like my high school, too. But instead
of a curse, it was crabs.
Okay, help me out here. Why does he love this
show so much?
Yippee, it’s backwards. I get it.
I don’t know. It’s just, he’s so passionate about so
many different things. I just don’t get that way. Do
you?
See? I wish I had some of that fire in
my life. I mean, I want to care about things
and get excited like you guys.
You think?
Ugh, that sounds like a lot of work.
So, I was thinking how excited you get about stuff
like Buffy or science or which TV remote you and
Sheldon should buy.
See, that’s the kind of passion I didn’t think I
had. But then I realized I’m passionate about you.
No, I’m serious. Look, I’ve always had these plans. I
was gonna be in movies and live this glamorous life,
and anything less than that just wasn’t worth getting excited
about.
Oh, obviously it’s gonna happen. Yeah, a psychic at a
bachelorette party told me so. Anyway, what I meant was,
I shouldn’t wait, you know? I’ve got you, I’ve got
Sheldon, all these wonderful friends. My life is exciting right
now.
It is, isn’t it?
Leonard, I had an epiphany, not a stroke.
Sheldon, you big weirdo, I want you to know that
I love that you’re in my life.
Got it.
Eh, his giant head did most of the work.
Who’s Professor Proton?
Yes! Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton.
Aw, so cute when you use the word cool wrong.
Like when kids say pasghetti.
Relax, Sheldon, he’s only a few minutes late.
Hello.
So, do you do a lot of appearances like this?
I think I know.
Okay, I didn’t know.
See, I’m not a scientist like them.
What’s that?
Shut up. You can do that? I mean, wouldn’t that
solve the world’s energy crisis?
I’m sorry to hear about your troubles.
But if you don’t mind me asking, uh, the potato
clock, how does it work? Is it a trick clock
or a trick potato?
Arthur, are you okay?
Any chance we could plug it into the potato?
We’ll pack up your stuff and meet you at the
hospital.
Vegas, here we come.
No.
I got a brand-new bikini, so drinks at the pool
are on these.
I’m sorry, why old?
Guess who?
Oh, it’s not so bad. You lost money, you’re filled
with shame and you got groped by a stranger. I
mean, that’s Vegas, you nailed it.
Oh, don’t worry, sweetie. No one has.
Okay, who wants a drink?
Oh, this isn’t alcohol. It’s a magic potion that makes
me like you.
I drink my potion.
You know what? Give me the dice, I want to
roll.
Yeah, well I’m supposed to be in Vegas throwing up
on a shrimp buffet. Now give it. All right, what
do I need?
Fifteen’s the point, the point is fifteen. Give the little
lady some room, here it is, coming out. Sixteen! Yes!
Oh, please tell me we’re playing for money.
More potion, please.
Pretend he’s that TSA agent. Come on.
No, it’s not.
Ooh, I have an idea. Since it’s not happening any
time soon, why don’t your character and your character do
it in the game?
Okay, we just want to say, we feel really bad
about…
So, then, during my afternoon shift, I spilled an entire
tray of drinks on myself.
Not really. My shirt was soaking wet. I got, like,
the biggest tip of my life.
I thought I said that to you.
Wow, Hawking. Good for you.
Well, how long?
Whoa. When would you leave?
Wow. Oh, okay, well, I’ll just come visit you.
On a ship? Aren’t they afraid Hawking will just roll
overboard?
Oh, sure. Like when you send me to kill spiders
in your bathtub. Wow. Okay. Four months.
Oh, sweetie, if you’re gonna screw things up, it’s gonna
be while you’re here, not while you’re away. No. I
mean, look, you have to go. It sounds like an
amazing opportunity. And I’m just basing that on how much
I didn’t understand what you said about it.
Okay. Good.
Sure.
Oh, I don’t know. Remember what happened when I took
care of your goldfish?
Sheldon, sweetie, shut up.
Bernadette, sweetie, shut up.
You know, maybe she’d be more comfortable meeting a girl
first.
What the hell?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, it does, and here we are.
Well, I’m his girlfriend, of course I’m gonna support him.
Honey, this is a big deal for Leonard, okay? He
gets to work with Stephen Hawking. Who, by the way,
will not be on the boat. I checked it out.
Oh, my God, Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard.
Look, sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel, okay?
But just because good things are happening to Leonard doesn’t
take anything away from you. You know what? Let me
tell you a little story. Once there was a girl
who worked at the Cheesecake Factory, and she wasn’t very
good at her job.
It wasn’t me. But she was also an actress, and
we were both up for the same part in a
toothpaste commercial. She got it. Look, I was so jealous.
But instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair…
I, looked her in the eye, smiled and said, I’m
happy for you. Because that’s what friends do.
Yeah.
Like this. I am so happy for you.
Cheers.
Raj, I’m so sorry.
Well, here we are.
I’m gonna miss you, too.
Okay, there’s no space in the white zone, so…
Did you bring enough inhalers?
And, uh, extra Dramamine? You remember what happened on It’s
a Small World.
Okay.
Oh, Leonard.
I love you.
Raj, it’s Penny. Are you in there?
Hey. I’m just coming back from the airport. I wanted
to see how you’re doing.
Can’t stay long. I left Sheldon in the car with
the window cracked open. He’s gonna go through that activity
book in, like, 30 seconds, so… Are you okay?
Oh. I’m so sorry.
Oh, Raj.
I know how you feel. I miss Leonard, too.
You will.
That’s just the booze talking.
You’re talking to me.
Oh, me, too.
That’s great. Do you want some wine?
