Your parents are old. Anything unspeakable was finished by 9
God, I thought my brother fresh out of jail was
gonna make everyone uncomfortable, but now this.
Okay, I'm gonna go pick up my family. Like an
hour and half, two hours, depending on traffic.
Oh, hey, and do yourself a favour, all right? When
Beverly gets here, do not bring up last night. All
right? As far as you're concerned, you don't know anything,
you didn't see anything. I want you just to play
dumb.
What? Oh. Hi. Okay, hey there, I got, I'm sorry,
I got to go now.
Why?
Okay, Beverley, aren't you overreacting a little? All we know
is they shared a cab and had a nightcap.
Yeah, plus if you leave, Alfred will know he got
under your skin.
Oh, I can't wait for you to meet everyone. I
told them all about you.
Uh, not everything, just, like, the jail and drugs part.
What?
Well, Mom, I'm sorry, but...
So, uh, Randall, can't believe after all these years you
finally get to visit me in California.
All right, you guys, uh, get settled in, then we'll
go across the hall and say hi to everyone.
I thought it was really funny.
Okay. Listen, Mom, I know you're nervous, but I promise
you, no one is gonna judge you or this family.
Pretty good. I actually just got assigned a much better
territory.
Well, I learned from the best.
Aw.
Hey.
Hey. Is everyone getting to know each other?
Okay, I understand everyone's a little tense today, so I
am just gonna get to the important stuff. Leonard, standing
here with you in front of our family and friends
is bringing up a lot of feelings. Like what a
good idea it was to elope the first time. But
also how incredibly happy you make me. Thank you for
marrying me. Hopefully for the last time.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, thanks, Mom.
Is he? I never noticed.
All right, we work at a giant pharmaceutical company. Get
him some anti-anxiety meds.
You know, when Leonard's feeling anxious I make him take
a long walk.
Well, for a while. Then he comes back.
No. You told me not to.
Would they really do that?
How did you think you were gonna hide your pregnancy?
Yeah, drive safe. We love you. And give us a
call... Oh, my God, it was me, it was me.
I'm the one who blabbed she was pregnant!
I didn't mean to. It just slipped out in front
of her assistant one day. I...
Oh, here's your coat, honey. That's such a cute jacket.
Oh God, I feel so bad, I just lied to
her.
Is that really what's important right now?
That's super helpful, Amy. Thanks a lot. I can't wait
to do that.
Hi.
Oh, had to go to a sales seminar on our
new sleeping pill.
Great.
In, like, two minutes. Yeah. So, how is everything going
around here? Are you still upset about people finding out
you're pregnant?
Sure, sure. Uh, did you ever figure out who told?
Hmm. Well, I guess it's just gonna remain a mystery,
you know, like whatever happened in that seminar after they
dimmed the lights.
Uh, you know, when I was in high school, there
was this girl who was talking about me behind my
back, so me and all my friends, we cornered her
in the bathroom and forgave her.
Okay, all right, honey, you know what? There was something
I was too scared to tell you yesterday, and now
I'm just balls-out terrified to tell you, but the truth
is it wasn't Barbara Chen, it was me. I'm the
reason everyone knows.
Well, it was an accident.I am so sorry I lied.
Oh, you know, I also lied about the girl in
the bathroom. Yeah, we actually dumped her retainer in the
toilet and put it back in her mouth.
Hi.
What are you doing?
Does he even like lemon bars?
Something happened at the meeting?
And you talked?
Well, if it makes you feel any better, Bernadette's mad
at me, too.
Why would that make me feel better?
Okay. Never mind.
Well, I told people at work that she's pregnant. She
wasn't ready for them to know.
Well, it just slipped out. I feel terrible.
Oh, hi.
Yeah, come on in.
Oh, thank you, and I'm sorry I lied about it.
Oh, that's what Amy said. So what's going on with
the research project? Are they gonna let you run it?
You threatened to sue?
That's funny. I learned something totally different.
Oh, that's so beautiful.
Good morning.
Oh, I'll go. I like a party.
It's okay, I'll still go.
Oh, I'll have some wine and listen to people go
on about crap I don't understand. I mean, how is
it any different than every single day of my life?
Hi.
How early are we?
I suddenly wish Sheldon was here.
So should we talk to each other or mingle?
Yeah, I mean, I could see him eating one or
two guests, but not a whole party.
Oh, it's funny, I was just thinking the same thing
about you.
Wait, what do you mean she's her?
No.
What? You tell me about your foot fungus, but this
is a secret?
Now Sheldon's popular? What is happening?
You trend setter.
Okay, okay, so Amy's cool, Sheldon's cool. Tell me about
Leonard.
Leonard Hofstadter.
That's me, I'm her. You know, he didn't trick me,
he just wore me down.
You know, I had no idea Caltech is exactly like
my high school.
Wow, you popular girls are mean.
Well, so are you. In fact, you know what? We
will never take you for granite. Did you get that?
Granite? A little geology joke.
Okay.
Ugh, did you lose anything valuable?
Oh, so nothing. Great. Do they know why the pipe
burst?
Well, if you need a place to crash, you can
stay with us.
Of course. You can stay in Leonard's room, and we'll
stay at my place.
No, not at all.
I guess so. And I'd finally get to live alone
with my husband.
Yeah, and we'll be right across the hall.
Okay, you guys had sex one whole time. Nothing can
put out a fire like that.
Don't be proud of that.
Well, where would you go?
Wait. Why don't you guys stay across the hall, and
we will live here?
Okay, it won't be that bad. We wouldn't even sit
in your spot while you're gone.
You know, I'm very proud of you for trying to
live with Amy.
Mm.
That was a cute story. So, um, what did you
want to ask me?
Mm. Well, the biggie is, if she has an insane
roommate, kick him out as soon as possible.
I know it sounds like a cliche, but compromise is
key.
Do little things, like bring her a cup of coffee
in bed.
You're gonna be seeing each other a lot, so respect
each other's personal space.
Well, here's your key.
Now, now, there's no need to make this emotional.
Yeah, you wrote it on my hand.
Good night.
Wa-how, we did it.
Wow. I cannot believe we are alone in our own
apartment.
So, what do you want to do?
Really? You're a genius, and that's the first thing you
come up with?
Ugh. Can we just have sex?
Inevitable, you say?
Wow, where did you learn these moves?
I told you not to do the worm.
Yeah, get it, girl.
Even more not what you think.
Yeah.
Was that a science diss?
Was it a good one?
Oh.
I feel like I should say damn.
Damn.
The new neighbours are weird.
Okay, I'm confused. Which one is Mr. Robot?
Can't.
Didn't.
Believe me, we know what you're going through.
Mm-hmm.
She's right. That's reasonable.
Yeah. You tell him, babe.
Sheldon, what do you say to that?
I hope one of those people is a monkey, Because
this is bananas.
All right. Well, let's just get them apart for a
while so they can cool down.
So it's okay for you to joke around?
Just as challenging?
As you?
Just as challenging as you?
Leonard breathes on me, too. It's not a big deal.
Well, so does Leonard. It's kind of annoying, but it's
not the end of the world.
You know, so does Leonard. Can't I just get ready
in the morning without him giving me his goofy thumbs-up?
Hey-hey-hey.
Agreed. Thank you.
You know, one night, Leonard's nose whistled so loud, I
swear it was like sleeping on a train track.
Is it? Oh. It's like his sinuses are right here
in the car.
Yeah, I'll take you for ice cream.
Oh, please, you're barely interested in a physical relationship with
one person. Why would you want to confuse and disappoint
others?
You kiss your mother with that mouth? BecauseCause it's fine.
Well, who you gonna hit on? The girl in front
of us got strawberry. That's your favourite.
What about the girl behind the counter?
Is it possible you might not actually want to meet
someone?
Thank you.
All right. Come on. What is really going on with
you?
All right.
Not relating. Go on.
Oh, now I'm with ya. Okay.
Oh, that's awful.
Well, what happened with your dad?
You poor thing.
And you're afraid you're gonna do something like your dad
did?
Down the road? Sheldon, she wanted to share a toothbrush
holder with you, and now you're at an ice cream
parlour trying to pick up women.
Honey, instead of worrying about pain you might cause in
the future, how about trying to fix the pain you're
causing her right now?
Okay.
Just finish your ice cream so I can get you
home to bed.
We're back.
We're doing good. I think Sheldon has something he would
like to say to Amy.
Do you want him back?
Call me crazy, but I found it moving.
Hey, have you ever heard of the Van Nuys Comic-Con?
I got asked to sign autographs there.
Well, it could be for the monkey movie. It could
be my haemorrhoid commercial. The list does not go on.
It doesn't matter. I'm not doing it.
You just said yourself, it's sad.
I don't know.
I guess it wouldn't hurt to meet some fans and
make a little extra money.
Oh, yeah.
What's all this?
Okay. Leonard, it's sweet you're excited about this, but it'll
be a miracle if one person asks for my autograph.
Who's that?
Oh, there's so much I want to change.
Really? I feel like I'm selling candy so our team
can get new uniforms.
Alright, why not five and ten bucks?
Hey, that guy's looking over here.
I don't know. Be cool. He's coming. He's coming. Hi.
Well, thanks.
Your love confuses me.
Okay. Who do I make it out to?
Okay.
That did not clear things up.
What's your name?
Okay.
Been hearing that a lot today.
Yep, there they are.
Here you go.
Well, go ahead. He's right over there.
Hello.
Thank you.
I assume we're still talking about the movies, but after
today, who knows.
Oh, sure.
Leonard...
Yeah, he really is.
And he started to slowly wear me down.
Yeah, except the river kept showing me his Pokemon cards.
I think it's hot.
You know, once, I proposed to him.
Yeah, that's gonna cost you later.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but can we watch
the news or something?
Yeah, I wonder what they're gonna do when her apartment's
ready.
Well, you've lied to Sheldon.
So, what's the deal with your apartment? Why's it taking
so long?
Oh, no, what happened?
Wet wall?
Mm. So why don't they just get more drywall?
Okay, are you done? Bernadette told me your apartment's ready.
But is Sheldon really believing all this crap?
Oh, don't worry, I won't.
The woman at the wall store?
Hi.
Yeah, we swung by her apartment on the way to
the restaurant, and they're gonna be fixing it for a
while.
I did, still a mess.
Ubabsubolubutubly ubi duboo.
Ubif Lubenubard tubold hubim, ubit's pubossubibuble.
Okay. That's enough. You know what? What is going on?
Uh, she's enjoyed living with you. It's called being in
love.
What? Tha... That is not true.
Oh, so, you believe your friend, and your friend's wife
and your own eyes over me? Wow.
Uh, did you notice your key chain?
Why did you tell Howard I was hiding Leonard's things?
And what? Your wizard robes are next to go.
Ubamy bube cubool.
That's a great idea.
Sweetie, once you stop paying rent, none of this is
really yours.
Thank you.
Okay, but you may feel some discomfort.
Do you really mean that?
Great, and just so you know, I'm not getting rid
of all your stuff.
That candle and you.
Uhbubububuh, I can make do with just the candle.
We turned your room into a sex dungeon.
Okay. Open your eyes and see your new room.
I know I went a little overboard. We can always
dial it back.
Oh, that means so much. I love you.
You're dating somebody, who is it?
You only watch what you eat when you're afraid you
might have to take your shirt off.
All right, fine, don't tell us.
All right.
Bam. Thank you. What's her name?
Well, that's great, Raj. You must have so much in
common.
How come you never eat broccoli?
Now, when he said make a baby, is it possible
he meant out of Legos?
Could you two really have some sort of super-intelligent child?
Yeah, but that's just his Earth parents. We don't know
anything about the ones that sent him here.
Ooh, Sheldon gonna get some.
So, were you turned on even a little bit?
Oh, I heard him interviewed on the radio. You know,
when they told him he won, he didn't believe it,
but then he did believe it. It was so funny.
You know what, I've met Bert. Isn't he an indicator
of life on other planets?
It's like scrolling through the emojis on my phone.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, angry?
I, I knew the answer. I got excited.
Well, and what happened to you?
This is getting old fast, Dolores, knock it off.
I do, your life is fine you big baby.
There you go.
There you go.
Aw, thank you.
What?
You liked my short hair, right?
Seriously, none of you liked it?
You know, how come nobody's talking about Howard's dopey haircut?
I think I hate all of you nerds.
I can't believe you punched Bert.
Oh, wow, that doesn't seem fair.
Oh, no, no, those hooks are gone.
Uh, we ran out of candy on Halloween, I was
just giving everything away.
Amy wants me to have it.
But it's a picture of you.
But you commissioned it.
But you like it so much.
I seem to be losing.
Why don't you keep it?
Yeah, I don't need anything around that I can stab
myself with.
So if it breaks there'd be none of it?
Thank you.
Leonard.
Uh, hang on. I don't think so, I'm clicking on
one weird trick for a flat belly, but I'm still
seeing celebrities who look like their pets.
Are you sure?
What a jerk.
Well, my go-to move is usually sleep with the person's
boyfriend, but I kind of feel like I'm already doing
that.
I think I'm gonna go for a run, you want
to come?
What, what are you doing in our apartment?
All right, Sheldon, this is over the line.
What do you think? Should we go to a hotel?
Okay, I'll go to a hotel. Text me in the
morning if you're still alive.
We're good, thank you.
Little lower to the left. A little more.
No, still hideous.
Yeah, you'd think that, but after a while it starts
showing up in your dreams.
Guys, wake up. Bernadette's having her baby.
Sheldon, what took you so long?
Hey.
Oh, that was fast. Did she sneeze the baby out?
Okay, well, we'll talk to you guys later. Bye. She
said not to come. It's gonna be a while.
Well, it doesn't matter. We're not going to the hospital
now.
Well while we're all awake, why don't we go to
a diner or something?
Oh, my God. It's your birthday. Let's do something fun.
We could go to a bar.
Oh, of course. The annual birthday booty spectacular!
I'm sorry, and what flavour is your bubble gum cigar?
All right, well, you two go have fun.
Oh, you sexy, wheezy little man.
Well, I didn't until I heard that.
Maybe if we're quiet, he'll go away.
Hey, Bernadette's water broke.
Howard and Bernadette's kid might be born on your birthday.
How cool is that?
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?
Okay, you don't have to say struggling every time. You
can just say actress.
You know, Raj, honey, you're being too hard on yourself.
When I first met you, you couldn't even talk to
women. I mean, you couldn't even talk if one was
in the room.
Anyone else want to try?
Hey, I bought M&Ms at the vending machine and two
bags came out.
Here.
Oh!
Does the baby have a name yet?
Oh.
Oh, look at all the babies.
Mm, that one kind of looks like Bernadette.
Hey, can you help me put some of the food
out?
Yeah, but he doesn't live here anymore.
Oh. It's Bernadette. She says they're running late. The baby
threw up on Howard, and then Howard threw up on
Howard.
Hi. Welcome back. How was Texas?
Well, you're home now.
I told him to take it down. He would not
listen to me.
So, what happened in Texas that was so bad?
Do boys have flowers?
Mm.
Oh, boy, I think it's about to get bad.
What?
That's too loud.
Hi. There's the little family!
Mm.
Yeah. Go ahead.
Oh, it's no problem, Amy and Sheldon were just telling
us about their trip to Texas.
Stop. Okay. They told Mary they were living together, there
was a fight, he got his feelings hurt, then he
put underwear on his head.
Okay. Then what happened?
So tell me, how did Sheldon look with an earring?
Actually, we got in a pretty nasty fight.
To be fair, we may have been on edge because
of the Christmas tree.
You do make a cute elf.
Hey, hey, I just found a farm where they let
you chop down your own tree.
No, what's stupid is a physicist who doesn't understand when
you swing an axe, you don't let go.
Ugh. It's 70 degrees, you didn't need mittens.
Yes, yes, you bruise, you peel. It's like I'm married
to an old piece of fruit.
Fine.
Leonard?
There's something on the windshield.
You need a break?
There's no shame in asking for a break.
Ugh. Leonard?
There's a tree on you.
Yeah, with gasoline and a match? Sure.
You poor things you must be exhausted.
So things started to turn around?
I can't believe you fit in the crib.
Our pleasure.
What, what's all this?
Oh, that is so thoughtful.
Yeah, i remember us driving up there, going to the
winery and, that's it.
Oh. Hey, what smells so good?
Pink wine and pizza bagels? It's like eighth grade all
over again. I am so lucky to have you.
Oh, you always know what not to say. I just,
i can't believe you did all this.
You did not just quote an Nsync song.
Oh.
I hadn't really thought about it.
Hey, can I ask you a question? You've been married
for a while, is it normal for the husband to
kind of completely stop giving a crap?
Well, Leonard used to do all these things, like bring
me flowers and wear pants.
Well, it's not just the pants, it's just, it's like
since we got married he doesn't really try any more.
Hey.
Oh, it was fine.
Uh, chips.
Some wine.
Hm. At least he took an interest.
Nothing.
I don't want to talk about it.
Fine. Lately I kind of feel like you've been taking
me for granted.
It's just, since we got married you seem to think
you don't have to try any more.
This is exactly why I didn't want to talk about
it.
Okay, you know what? Maybe I'll take Amy with me
to the spa this weekend instead.
All right, we're heading out.
Thanks. Are you ready?
Let's go.
When was the last time you got a massage?
Leonard stood on me once, too, but he was just
trying to see the Rose Parade.
Well, yeah.
What are you doing here?
Okay. Leonard, I really appreciate that, but I need a
little time to myself.
All right. Can you please just go and we'll talk
about this tomorrow?
I'm trying to figure it out.
Hey.
We're not getting divorced.
Yeah. And there are a few things we need to
stay on top of. So we thought it would useful,
and I can't believe I'm about to say this, um.
Although a rule about him texting me from in there
might help with the romance.
Do you really think that's funny?
Article 8, subsection B, Leonard will restrict videogaming in underpants
to hours Penny is not home. This includes boxers, briefs,
thongs, G-strings or anything else that calls attention to his
pasty little thighs.
I think this all looks good.
Hey, boys. How's it going?
No. No, you don't, you really don't. I actually can't
say don't enough.
Wow, I find that hard to believe.
I take it back. I believe it.
Hey, can you hold off redoing the room? My brother's
coming out here in a few weeks.
My dad asked if I can get him a job
interview at my work.
Well, I sell pharmaceuticals. That's just a really hard to
spell word for drugs.
I, I'm not sure. Maybe a few days. Unless he
gets the job, then who knows?
You don't have a problem with this, do you?
Okay. Thank you, you're the best. Mm.
Hey, would you take a look at my brother's resume?
I'm trying to help him clean it up a little.
He didn't know it till he was cuffed, but yeah.
No, it's my brother's. I'm trying to help him get
a job out here.
What? Are you really upset about Randall coming?
Leonard, if you're mad about this, just tell me.
He's my brother. I didn't think I needed your permission.
Like you talked to me about your gaming room?
If you were this upset, why didn't you say so
when I told you?
Well, you sound like one now. I don't see the
big deal if my brother comes and stays for a
while.
He would get his own place.
Yes.
It still counts. You know, how is this any different
from you making me live with Sheldon?
You gave me a bill at the end of every
month.
Look, we got really angry at each other, and you
just got caught in the middle of it.
Yes, we're fine.
Hopefully, he won't be too upset.
He won't be mad at me. I mean, you're the
one who doesn't want my brother to come, so...
Oh, I'm gonna throw you so hard, I might actually
win a stuffed animal.
So, did you wind up sending that machine back?
So, all we need to do is get Sheldon knocked
up.
I can't believe you have to fill out a preschool
application for an infant.
All right, you know what you need? A night away
from all of this. You know, where you can just
kind of relax and, I'm just gonna turn this off.
Much better. Seriously, let's plan a night, you know, give
you a break. We could go dancing.
Okay, that's the one to beat.
All right. You guys ready to get crazy?
You know, if you pump at the bar, I promise
we'll get free drinks.
No. She's busy. You call Howard.
Okay, stop that. No more preschool talk. Tonight is about
having fun.
Okay, give. Can you guys handle this or not?
Sorry, guys. This club was so great, how could they
turn it into a bookstore? I thought we got rid
of all those.
Is everything okay?
Maybe we should just call it a night.
I'm just not really in the mood anymore.
I don't know. This is all starting to feel like
a sad attempt to recapture our youth.
Okay, maybe I'm the one who's sad.
Maybe the fact that you went and had a baby.
No, of course not. I just, I didn't think it
would make me have all these feelings.
Pressure. I mean, she's looking at preschools, she has a
minivan, she has a 401 K. Before she talked about
it, I just thought that was a race.
I get that, okay? It's just, Leonard and I have
been married for two years, and we're no further along
than when we were dating.
Yeah, I guess I am making decent money.
Oh, that's gonna make me cry.
Ew.
What is happening?
Aw, look at you watching sports.
Okay, I want in. Ten bucks says I'll lose interest
before that thing stops spinning.
Yeah, see, what's happening here signals brain damage. My God,
how long does this thing spin for?
You know, we could've come to you guys. You didn't
have to bring the baby here.
Yeah, until someone left him in the drugstore parking lot
and he freaked out.
Oh, someone's been shopping at Gucci.
That must've been expensive.
And if you really want to hurt him, I look
great in Chanel.
Wait, Leonard, he's hurting. Let him feel how he feels.
Yeah. Shoes, I'm a seven-and-a-half, boots, I'm an eight.
All right, how much exactly does he pay for?
Yeah, women do like a man that can support himself.
All right, hang on. We can figure this out. Let's
just go over your expenses. How much is your rent?
You don't how much your rent is?
Yeah.
Well, sometimes you can get free food and Wi-Fi from
the neighbours. Just know you might have to marry one
of 'em.
Raj, if you need a place to stay, of course
you are welcome here.
Okay, only if you're sure. Whew.
Hi.
Oh, let me guess. You guys are drafting your fantasy
accounting firms.
Well, he has a job. How bad can it be?
Wait, wait, not shopping for clothes, right? Because look.
Wait, wait, who's gonna break it to the penguin?
Well, Leonard wants me to do more stuff like that
with him, so I thought maybe this year I'd tag
along.
So, do you want to come?
Please? I went to your boring thing last month.
Come on, even you checked your e-mail during the eulogy.
It's not that I want to go, I just think
it'll make Leonard happy. And if I have to watch
him squeeze into an Ewok costume, so be it.
Wow, that is a lot of people jammed in there.
Oh, you really sleep on the sidewalk, huh?
Well, you and I would get our own room, right?
Well, it's no different than when Sheldon used to climb
in bed with us during a thunderstorm.
You know, it's no big deal. I can put up
with anything for three days.
Are you kidding me?
I can't, it'll break his heart. You know, he's always
making an effort to do things with me he doesn't
enjoy, like going outside.
You know, maybe it won't be that bad. Leonard says
it's really mainstream now. Comic books aren't just for sad
nerds any more. I mean, it is still a key
part of their demographic.
Is there any scenario where we're not in full body
paint?
Hey, um, are you sure the guys are okay with
me coming?
This is just something you usually do together, and if
I'm screwing it up, I don't have to go.
Why? Do you not want me to go?
Okay, good, Because that's what I want, too.
Hey.
Hey, babe, you want to drive?
No, it's fine, I know you don't like the way
I drive.
Just so you know, that guy in the parking lot
hit me.
Just say you want to drive.
Amy, do us a favour, please drive.
It's not complicated. Amy's driving, that's it.
You're the one who seems upset.
Wait, you don't want me to go?
I just thought it would make you happy.
Hold on, I'm trying to decide if I'm mad at
you. No, I'm happy I don't have to go.
Okay.
Hey, if you're still looking to make money, I will
pay you to burn that jacket.
Yeah, there's room in the bed by Sheldon's feet.
Really?
Ooh, how about white-water rafting?
What? Is it another video of him and his dog
Lady-and-the-Tramping some spaghetti?
You're a good friend.
You're an even better husband.
Hey, pal, you want to live here or not?
What's it for?
Yeah, it's yours.
She'll be in her crate, it's not a big deal.
Well, it's like that science thing. For every action, you
have a gigantic and annoying reaction.
Mm-hmm.
Raj, you don't have to serve us.
Hi.
Wait, is anything gonna jump out of that.
You didn't do anything. It's Sheldon.
So, relax. We're happy to have you.
Do you actually pay for that haircut?
What are you talking about? We're fine.
Yeah, this is a special circumstance.
Yeah, well, a circumstance can happen twice and still be
special.
Are you kidding me?
Now you're taking her side?
Morning.
What? Why?
I feel terrible.
Well, you're the one worried having someone live with us
is a sign of problems.
All right, so we'll ask him to come back.
Don't you want to get dressed first?
We're so sorry if we made you feel uncomfortable. We
really weren't fighting about you.
More reasons for you to stay.
Then it's settled.
Oh, that's beautiful. What does it mean?
Yeah, I guess they don't have Sanskrit for butts up
and heads down.
Oh, right, sorry.
If you want, I can get ready in five minutes.
Yeah, bye, sweetie.
Yeah, yeah, bye, Leonard.
No, I was going to, but she called in sick.
And guess who else called in sick.
Paul.
Oh, you met him at the office Christmas party. He's
married to Nancy.
I bet Jennifer gets a promotion out of this, which
is so unfair because I work twice as hard as
she does.
Well, I hope not. I just hate when people play
those kinds of games.
Mm.
Okay, how is that?
Well, this is a moisturizing mask.
Hey, I hope you don't mind, I used a little
of your eye cream last night.
Don't worry about it. Hey, after this, how about we
all go out and do something together?
Ooh, yes. Fun.
I probably should have spit out my gum first.
Mm. Well, we've loved having you around. Right, sweetie? Leonard?
Yeah, that's rude.
Well, sweetie, that's crazy.
Well, why wouldn't this be a safe place? I mean,
he's surrounded by his wife and one of his best
friends.
Yeah, you're right. You know, you're really sensitive about this
kind of stuff.
Yeah.
What?
Hey, Leonard, if you're not busy tomorrow, I have to
do a little reception after work.
Oh, are you sure? We're celebrating our new ADD drug,
and it'll probably be over in, like, six minutes.
Hey, Raj, do you want to go with me tomorrow?
Uh-oh. Someone's got two dates to the nerd prom.
Hey, since when do you do laundry on a Thursday?
You know, there was a time I would say what's
a soup sack? But I'm glad we're past that. You
know, there was a time I would say God bless
you, and then you would say if you must invoke
an imaginary deity, how about Thor? And I would say,
how do you know I didn't mean Thor? And then
you would say Touche, and that there ends the tale
of why I no longer say God bless you.
Oh, yeah. So, Leonard tells me you've had a busy
day.
Are you getting sick?
Well, you're pretty delicate. Maybe you shouldn't be pushing yourself
so hard.
All right. Well, we'll just pretend that you didn't catch
a cold watching Frozen.
You also got a nosebleed watching Up.
It's nine o'clock.
I don't know, check your body for tattoos?
Okay, it's just a notebook, what's the big deal?
Look, it's got to be around here somewhere.
The notebook isn't in the bathroom.
Well, people who are abducted by aliens lose time. I
mean, maybe it happens to the aliens, too.
Oh, that, that's so cool. How do you, how do
you turn that thing off?
I don't even run there, I drive.
Oh, wait. I remember.
Yes. Please find someone who cares.
Hey, I already set up Howard and Bernadette. It's your
turn to ruin some poor girl's life.
So is this your first time dating a scientist? BecauseCause
I'm thinking of starting a support group.
, Bert, you were telling us how you updated your
profile?
Oh, is that offer for everybody?
Aw, that's so weird.
You know, on our first date, Leonard used a coupon
to buy me a pretzel.
The end.
I think it's Bert.
Oh.
Bert, you're a good guy, you deserve a woman who's
interested in more than just your money.
Look, sweetie, relationships aren't about money, okay? It's about respect
and having things in common and... yes, Sheldon?
All that and he's shorter than me.
I didn't know you could drink while you're breastfeeding.
Ooh. I'm gonna get another. You want food?
Oh, Zack. Hey.
Well, it's a bar, so pretty good. Uh, what's new?
Well, congratulations.
No, on, on getting engaged, good for you.
Yes, yes, he's working for the government on an infinite
persistence gyroscope. Of course, the first time I say it
right, he's not even here.
Uh, yeah, sure, I'll check with Leonard.
Hey, you ready to go?
What's the matter?
What? He loves you, okay? And he's interested in your
work. You could talk about the infinite perspective... I swear
I know it.
Well, and his fiancee will be there, so you know,
if the conversation lags, we can talk about their wedding.
Come on, I spent an entire plane ride with you
talking about the trailer for Deadpool 2.
Hi. Hey, where's your fiancee?
Oh, no, what happened?
Uh, it's okay, I'm still in pharmaceutical sales.
Yeah, lying isn't my favourite part of the job. Actually,
I'm not crazy about a lot of it.
Oh, that's a nice offer.
Right, Because it spells menu.
See, that wasn't so bad. He even picked up the
check.
Well, maybe, I mean, it seems kind of perfect. I
have sales experience, and I've been a waitress, so I
have restaurant experience, and if he's figuring out my Christmas
bonus, we could buy a boat.
You work with Sheldon, you tell me.
Okay, are you seriously jealous of me working with Zack?
Great, so you want me to stay at a job
I'm not happy at?
You okay? You kind of look like Zack trying to
figure out that tip.
So he's my ex-boyfriend, who cares? I can't believe Leonard
would be so insecure.
And Zack's engaged. Leonard has no reason to feel threatened.
What, you wouldn't trust him?
Yeah, that, that is the sexiest dog.
BecauseCause he's scared of you?
Yeah.
Hey.
You want to talk?
Look, we can have a reasonable conversation and I won't
get mad. I don't like it after sex, and I
don't like it now.
Yeah. All right, just come here. Look, I get me
working with Zack is weird and I don't want you
to be uncomfortable.
Then what do we do?
No, I know you'll try, but it'll make you miserable,
which will make me miserable, and I'm just gonna stay
where I'm at for now.
You don't need to do that, it's okay.
Okay, are you sure about this?
Hey, uh, so I've been thinking about it and I
want to take the job.
Oh, so there's no job?
Okay, thanks anyway. Bye. Well, his fiancee thought the idea
of us working together was stupid. You were right, I
was wrong. Aren't you gonna say anything?
Champagne, champagne.
And for the world's tallest second grader, apple juice.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Um, well, I, yeah, you got me.
And when? But also where?
Okay, we're just gonna circle back to when he's moving
out? Okay, that's cool.
Good for you.
Oh, come on, he's a grown man, he can take
care of himself.
Once again, you got me.
Oh, hey, what's going on?
What?
Amy's got some news.
So, did you tell him about Princeton yet?
Oh, sweetie, you might not live that long.
Oh, stop it, he'll be fine.
Oh, damn, wait, you know, maybe you shouldn't go.
I mean, I like a little brown sugar.
Sorry.
Oh, come on. Look, if the roles were reversed, he'd
be on the first train to New Jersey, or the
second train if there were teenagers on the first one.
Well, what's wrong with that?
And yet you bore his child. Neato.
Okay, a simple yes will do.
Okay, listen to me. Your relationship can handle being long
distance for a while. It's not like you two are
very physical.
A lot of lectures?
Oh, we would love that.
I want to, but I don't think I can.
Okay, I'm good now.
Not only did they eat together, Leonard said he made
her laugh.
Did he Purell?
I cannot believe Leonard mentioned the Toblerone but left that
part out.
I don't know; we shouldn't worry her if it's nothing.
Yeah. Do you think living with Amy has somehow stirred
up Sheldon's sexual appetite?
All right, then we agree. He's not making any moves,
it's this Dr. Ramona chick.
Really? All I got from Leonard was the Toblerone bar
had nuts.
Oh, hey, Amy.
We thought you meant not letting him run out into
traffic.
No. Come on, it's Sheldon. Nothing is gonna happen.
Well, what do you want us to do?
Come on. Looks don't matter to Sheldon. Because he only
has eyes for you.
Thanks. I was scrambling.
Do you really think there's reason to worry?
All right, well, that doesn't prove anything.
The point is this could be nothing and we are
all overreacting.
Hi.
So, Sheldon, have you talked to Amy?
Okay, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that exactly
what we were supposed to stop from happening?
You got fingers and a mouth, you call her.
All right, this is making me crazy. Somebody's got to
go over there.
Will you go with me?
Sure.
We'll all go.
Pardon. I just need to., yeah.
We need to talk.
Okay, I know you don't have a lot of experience
with women, but Ramona seems to have a romantic interest
in you.
Well, sometimes women don't care. Sometimes it makes them want
a guy even more.
Okay. Um, let's try this. Think of yourself as one
of those limited edition toys people like to collect.
Well, then you get it.
Right.
Let's forget the toy thing, okay? Um, maybe...
All right. What do you think is happening?
Don't look at me like that, I tried.
