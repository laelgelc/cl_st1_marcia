What’s the matter?
Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?
Aw.
Good night.
You know what? That would make me feel better. Thank
you.
No.
Why don’t you just admit you only want to play
this game because you always play it with Leonard and
you miss him?
Mmm.
Okay, I get it, I get it. You are an
emotionless robot.
All right, let’s just get this stupid game over with.
Okay.
Why?
Really? Why?
So that means I lose, right? It’s over?
Okay, let’s take a break.
I wasn’t going to get alcohol. Gosh, I wonder what
Leonard’s doing right now. I miss him so much.
I’m calling him.
Leonard?
Wow, it sounds like you’re having a good time.
Uh, okay, well, we were just calling you because we
were missing you.
Leonard, Leonard? I cannot believe we were missing that jerk.
I can’t believe it. All this time I’ve been doing
nothing but sit around and miss that guy. And you
know what the worst part is?
No. Yeah. But you know what the second-worst part is?
He does not miss me at all.
Really? That, that’s it? That’s comforting?
No. Come on, you’re supposed to say, of course he
misses you, the only reason he’s partying is to cover
up his pain.
This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because he’s
off having a good time?
Okay, that, that’s great. You can stop trying to make
me feel better now.
He did?
Oh, that’s really sweet.
Well, now I miss him even more.
Thanks.
Come on. It’s still early. Let’s do something.
How about we just talk?
No. Come on, let’s talk about our lives. Tell me
something about you I don’t know.
Okay, that, that’s a good start, but I was thinking
maybe something a little more personal.
How about I go first?
Okay, look, here’s something people do not know about me.
When I first moved out to L.A., I did a
topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer
gorilla. Ugh! After I did it, I felt so ashamed.
Thankfully, that thing never came out.
Oh, God.
Okay.
That’s your big revelation?
Okay, you know what? I give up. I’m going to
bed.
What did I do?
I, I didn’t think it was a big deal.
Sheldon, you are right. I’m really sorry. I should’ve known
better.
Thank you. How about a hug?
Come on.
Ah, I’m so glad the police finally caught that psychotic
genetically engineered ape.
Aaaaaaah!
Another? Great.
Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere.
You know, I will miss this.
I won’t.
Yeah, I didn’t stay for the detention, I’m not gonna
read the report card.
Leonard! Hi!
Oh, my God. You weren’t supposed to be here till
Sunday.
Oh, my gosh, why are we whispering?
Oh, that is so romantic.
Oh, I just cannot believe you’re here.
Ah.
Oh. Oh, that’s the pizza.
Thank you.
Hey.
Okay, here’s, uh, twenty-five. Keep the change.
Oh. Okay. Well, here’s, um, thirty something cents and a
promise I won’t call your boss and tell him you
reek of marijuana.
That’s nice.
Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel like eating alone
tonight, so…
Uh, yeah, it sounds fun, but no thanks. Have a
good night!
No. No, no, no. You know what? The toilet’s been
doing that. I called the building manager, so…
Well…
Yeah, no, no, no. You know what, Sheldon, it’s okay.
You don’t have to go into the bathroom.
Oh. Well, you know, I, I’ve got two hands and
a bit of a drinking problem.
Oh.
Um, what?
So? That’s my dinner from last night.
Okay. Look, honey, I promise there’s no one’s here. I‘ve
had a long day. I just want to have a
quiet dinner by myself.
What?
No.
What the hell?
Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that.
No, he doesn’t.
It was fine.
Ooh, now we’re talking.
Oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?
He’s still mad at Leonard, huh?
I don’t know what succubus is, but it has suck
in it, so that can’t be good.
Hey, Sheldon.
Come on, don’t be like that. We had so much
fun together the last couple of months.
Sheldon.
I’m so glad you guys are friends again.
Aw.
Fifty cents off Vagisil.
Me, too.
Think of Sheldon when you apply it.
I love scavenger hunts. My friends and I had them
all the time.
Oh, in ours we would just run around town looking
for a store that would sell us beer.
Yeah, me, too.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why don’t you just admit you don’t
want to be on a team with me.
Mm-hmm, yeah, you don’t think I’m smart enough. You think
I’m gonna be a liability. Even though I totally just
used the word liability correctly in a sentence. Yeah.
No, no. Let’s mix things up. I choose Sheldon, and
we’re gonna kick your ass!
Thank you. Do you want to be on my team?
All right, hurry up and close the door so they
can’t hear us. Would you stop pouting? So, you picked
my name. Get over it.
No.
Well, there’s no right way, Sheldon. I already found a
few pieces that fit.
Ooh, ooh, it’s the comic book store. All right, come
on, that’s where we have to go.
But, it, it doesn’t matter. We know the answer, come
on.
Okay, it’s not gonna say that.
It’s the comic book store, it’s the comic book store,
it’s the comic book store.
Ugh, we’re the last ones here, hurry up.
People run in a marathon.
Riddle me this…
Hey, Princeton, look at that, Team Community College Night School
is in the lead.
Aha. Okay, let’s see. To continue on your quest, leave
no stone unturned. Ooh.
Oh. Okay. Sheldon, I, I’ve got to ask, how did
you figure out that it was the geology lab?
Yes.
Wow. I can drink a beer underwater.
Shut up. I solved it.
Well, wait. Don’t you want to know how I figured
it out?
Okay. Oh, it’s a bowling alley.
Let’s go.
Three bags, no one’s opened ’em. we’re the first ones
here.
What? Why me?
Okay, the clue must be in the bag.
It’s just a bunch of pants.
You know, I’m surprised you want to copy my answers
since I’m not even smart enough to be on your
team.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, well, you should have quit ’cause I’m still gonna
beat your ass.
Oh.
But wait. So does this one.
Sheldon’s spot. The coin is in your spot.
Hurry.
Well, where the hell’s the coin?
I don’t get it.
That is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.
Run.
Run to India.
Hi. I thought you went to the comic book store
on Wednesdays.
Oh, good. Check it out, The Disappointing Child by Beverly
Hofstadter.
Yeah. It’s on the recommended reading list for my psychology
class.
Oh, cool. Are there pictures?
Oh, come on. Why? How bad could it be?
Not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?
Oh, my God, you still go left.
Okay, I know you don’t want to talk about it,
but can I just ask you one question about your
mom’s book?
I just want to know why a five-year-old boy puts
on his mom’s make-up and wears balloon boobies.
You were wearing her bra.
Okay, okay. But you know, as a student of psychology
who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment, I
think, sometimes, it’s good to open up about these things.
Well, why were you so angry?
Sweetie, I’m so sorry. I wish there was something I
could do to make you feel better.
Really? Are you sure about that?
Yep. Hey, and maybe this time you don’t try and
talk sports with the guys.
Oh, come on. Every time we’re about to hang out
with my friends, you don’t want to. It’s like, It’s
too loud, or the bathroom’s too dirty, or they put
a chicken wing in my ear. I mean…
Hey, what’s going on with you?
All right, hang on. is this still about your mom’s
book?
‘Cause if you’re still upset about that, we don’t have
to go.
I’m so sorry. I never should have read that book.
You know what? You want to just get dinner and
watch the game here?
Okay.
Hi. All right, sweetie. You hang in there today.
Okay.
Oh, just a little treat. I know you’ve been feeling
really bad about your mom lately.
And I wanted to make you feel better, so I
planned something very special for you.
Bernadette told me everything. Now you don’t get the left
or the right.
Awkward silence, Sheldon on his phone, no touching. Somebody’s having
date night.
How do you not tear off his clothes and take
him right here on this table?
You know, not a lot of people know this, but
the monoamine oxidase enzyme was discovered by a woman, Mary
Bernheim. That’s right, my phone is just as smart as
you guys.
Sheldon, I don’t understand. I thought you said you were
fine with it.
Yeah, and you can’t tell her what she can and
cannot do.
That’s different. I’m not going to the mall with someone
dressed like a dumb space bear.
Oh, no.
Why’d you get that? You hate lamb.
Okay, Sheldon, what happened between you and Amy?
Yeah.
Okay, fine, Sheldon. What is your side?
Nope, got to go with Amy on this one.
All right, don’t worry. I talked to Leonard. He is
gonna sit the guys down and set them straight.
What are you working on?
Do you know what he’s doing?
Uh, Sheldon, you want to take a break? Your food’s
ready.
Aw, what horrible thing are you trying to make up
for?
Ah.
Yeah. Hey, how come you’ve never done anything romantic to
celebrate our first date?
I can name tons.
Oh. I know, what about that bed-and-breakfast?
I know what I did. I bet they had to
throw out that rocking chair. You know, I can be
romantic if I want to.
Okay, just you wait and see. I’m gonna romance your
freakin’ ass off.
Sheldon?
Thank you so much for coming.
Okay, good, ’cause I’ve been really struggling with this.
Pants, but Leonard says sex doesn’t count.
I don’t know if I want to cook for him.
He’s kind of a picky eater. I mean, it’s too
salty, it’s too dry, it’s too burnt and frozen at
the same time. Okay, come on, what else would sweep
you off your feet?
Okay, that’s just the plot for Dirty Dancing. What else
would you love? Other than being lifted over Patrick Swayze’s
head.
That’s from Say Anything.
I get that, but why is this so hard?
Yeah, I’m trying to be sad about that. I can’t.
Boy, Bernadette is gonna love this.
Okay, you know what’s not romantic? Rubbing it in someone’s
face.
Damn it, everyone’s better at this than me.
What?
And he’d probably still live with his mom.
And he’d definitely still live with his mom.
Oh, we couldn’t have imagined how good our lives would
get from the moment that we met you, Bernadette.
I discovered a secret ingredient. The flavour packet. That sucker
is well named. All right, lover boy, get ready, ’cause
there is a crap storm of romance coming your way.
Oh, I am. Maybe if you follow this trail, you’ll
see why.
Yes. The most beautiful and shockingly expensive of all the
flowers.
Okay, I gave this a lot of thought, and I
finally found something to show you how much I love
you.
It’s a first edition of Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.
I remember it was your favourite book growing up.
What?
No. Something’s going on. What’s wrong with it? I remember
you saying how great it would be to have a
first edition.
Oh, my God, I am the worst.
No, it’s not. I mean, what’s thoughtful is everything you
do. Here, you know what? Look at this. Look, here’s
the, the plane ticket you bought me when I was
too poor to go home for the holidays. And the
rose you left on my windshield just because. Here’s the,
the thank-you letter you wrote me after the first time
I slept with you. All 11 pages of it.
Of course I did. It’s you.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, just the first one. I didn’t save them
all.
Good, I’m just having little trouble with the glue.
Yeah, but only because I was dating a second grader.
Yeah, I’m just making a mess.
When did I have pistachios?
Hey, guys, what do you think?
Thanks. Target, four ninety-nine. I’m getting a drink.
What’s going on with them?
Hey, guys.
It was not funny.
Ooh, that looks like fun.
Oh, that’s amazing,
Raj, cool it, he’s gonna make us hair diamonds.
Hey, Arthur. How are you?
Sorry, they’re both married.
Mmm.
Hey, can I ask you a question?
You’ve had this dart board since I’ve known you, but
I’ve never seen you play.
What window?
Ooh, what are you gonna get?
Aw, did she hate you?
No, if it was a spider, Lenny would’ve flipped out.
Yeah, it’s freaking me out. I’m gonna go.
Yeah, hang on, just give me sec.
I scraped gum off the bottom of that table. Only
’cause my manager saw me put it there.
I don’t know why but I always pictured her as
Indian.
I’m gonna go talk to her.
I’m not gonna say anything. I just want to check
her out. Because she hurt my friend. My Indian friend.
Who’s racist now?
Yeah, well, you’re short.
Hey, can I start you off with something to drink?
Okay. Um, you’re Lucy, right? I’m a friend of Raj
Koothrappali’s. Actually Amy recognized you.
Oh, you know, he’s good.
Yeah, this is none of my business. But why did
you break up with him in an e-mail?
Yeah, I get that. I’ll go get you your water.
When you say easier, you mean easier for you, right?
‘Cause it certainly didn’t make it easier for him.
I’m sorry, this is rude of me. I will go
get that water. See, see, see, see. Just now you
expressed your feelings to my face. How come you could
do that with me, but not Raj?
You know what the worst part is? You’re sitting here,
perfectly happy and he’s at home, a blubbering mess.
Well, I also said I was getting you water, but
look at me still standing here. You know, I may
be a bad waitress, but you are a bad person.
Now, you want to hear the specials?
Hey, if you guys were hungry, why didn’t you order
something at the restaurant?
Oh, that’s right. Nachos and a turkey club.
Well, I was too busy standing up for my friend
to worry about your, I want to say salmon.
What do you mean how? What’s the big deal?
Okay, you guys are overreacting. Raj is gonna appreciate how
I had his back.
What are you doing?
Sheldon’s not here. Why don’t you take the sweater off?
Which is?
Oh, my God! Is that sweater made of bees? Come
on, take it off. I won’t tell.
Sweetie, every night you don’t kill him in his sleep,
he wins.
Smile.
So you can send it to Princeton and get your
money back.
There’s a girl at the Cheesecake Factory I can set
you up with.
What is wrong with you?
Yes, it is.
Oh, stop it. I’ve seen you eat, like, a million
hamburgers.
Look, I’m telling you I’ve done it, okay? I clearly
remember the cow standing up and then the cow on
its side.
I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?
That would explain why the sky was also on its
side.
Howard. Cow tipping. Real or not?
Uh, we were actually gonna do it here.
Yeah, me, too.
Sheldon, you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere. I spent
one in Vegas.
Yeah, back when I was dating Zack. It was actually
more fun than I thought. We gambled, we went to
one of those cheesy wedding chapels, we had a really
good turkey dinner. Which was surprising, since we were at
a strip club.
Yeah.
We had one of those silly fake weddings.
No, they’re not.
No, they’re not.
But it didn’t seem real.
Ugh, would you stop? We just did it as a
goof.
I will. Why are you making this such a big
deal?
So how do I undo this?
Great, well, what do I have to do?
Want of understanding? What does that even mean?
Here. Thank you for having us.
I can’t believe I felt bad for opening this in
the car.
Fine.
Are you done?
Look, I get it, I screwed up. Is this all
we’re gonna talk about the rest of the day?
Ugh, I need some air.
Well, you’ll be happy to know I just spoke to
Zack and he’s willing to sign the court papers. He’s
on his way here now.
Yeah.
Because you wouldn’t shut up about it. When I called
him, he had nothing to do, so I just thought
it would…
Oh, sorry. We’ll keep it down.
Yeah, okay, great. Can we just get this over with?
Okay.
We don’t have any kids.
Okay, look, Zack, come on. You know neither of us
thought this was real. I mean, we were married by
an Elvis impersonator.
Hang on. You know what? You have been a jerk
about this all day. You always do this, whenever I
mess up, you’re right there to make me feel even
worse about it.
Yeah, we could’ve waited till Monday, signed the papers, this
all would have been over.
Oh, there you go again, just another mistake you’re throwing
in my face.
I’m about to. Sign the paper.
Hey, I’m sorry about today. And I promise, next time
I get married, it won’t be a joke. It’ll be
for love. Or money.
How can you not be happy? You’re tall, thin and
famous. Oh, my God, I’m jealous of Sheldon.
Mmm, you clearly haven’t been with me at Mardi Gras.
Hey, what’s with all the yelling?
Oh, that’s great. You must be thrilled,
He’s counting hobbits and superheroes, right?
Actually, I get what he’s saying.
It’s like if you’re dating someone you’re not that into,
and then they break up with you and then you
want them more than ever.
Bark once if you need me to call PETA.
You know, if it makes you feel any better…
You’re probably right.
You know, if we did a shot every time they
said something embarrassing, this would be one hell of a
drinking game.
Wow, you’re really good at this.
How you doing over there?
Hey, Sheldon, you want to play next?
Oh, she’s pregnant? That’s great. You’re gone an uncle. Uncle
Sheldon.
Wow, so, how long will you be gone?
Yeah, which means we don’t have to use his ridiculous
ornament-spacing template.
Ah.
Honey, I’m a little strapped for cash this year, so
for Christmas I was thinking of giving you this.
Okay.
Yeah.
Hi.
Hey, how’s your sister?
Yeah, if he’s in the room when they’re making the
baby, I’ll give you ten dollars.
Hey, you ever imagine what that would be like? Not
being born?
Oh, you weren’t joking.
Okay, sweetie, let me tell you exactly how that would
have gone down.
Hey, you guys ready to order or you need a
few minutes?
A few minutes it is.
Yeah?
Really? You don’t sound so sure.
What’s that?
I think you’re too late.
Sure, why?
Why?
Hey. Did you remember to pay the rent?
Hey, he may be an idiot, but at least he
didn’t pee himself.
Me, too.
Oh, come on. Childbirth is a natural, beautiful, uuurgh, it’s
like someone sawed a cow in half.
We do?
Hey, Sheldon.
Doing laundry?
Oh, my inference is justified. Sheldon, you are so funny.
Anyway, I need to do my laundry, too, because these
clothes are so dirty. Almost as dirty as the dirty
girl who’s wearing them.
Okay, that’s enough.
So, what do you think?
Please, Sheldon. I need you.
To take me.
Come on, Sheldon. You and me right here.
I think I know how to change your mind.
Great.
What do you mean, not exactly?
Amy, what about you? What do you think you’d be
doing if you never met Sheldon?
Aw.
Who’s that?
You guys need anything else?
I’m sorry, I have a boyfriend. In fact, there he
is now. Ready to go, sweetheart?
Guys, guys, you’re never gonna believe this.
I just got a part on a TV show.
Um, NC… II… or, you know, NCSTD… I don’t know,
it’s, it’s, you know, it’s the one with the letters
and I’m gonna be on it!
Yeah.
Um, I play a customer in a diner and I
flirt with Mark Harmon.
Well, yeah. Why?
Hey, guys, don’t forget, my episode’s on TV tomorrow night.
Oh, that’s so sweet of you, but I was gonna
steal food from here. You know, my treat.
We haven’t even gotten to my scene yet.
Okay, shh, guys, guys, this is it.
Are you kidding me?
Well, the diner scene. Where’s my diner scene?
No, there was supposed to be a big scene with
me and Mark Harmon, but it’s gone.
They must’ve cut it.
This doesn’t make any sense. I mean, I, I thought
I did a, a really good job, I… Excuse me.
No, Dad, I don’t think they cut me out of
the show because I was too pretty. No, I don’t
need you to come out and kick Mark Harmon’s ass.
Daddy, I gotta go. I love you. Bye.
Ugh, this is such a disaster. My parents had all
my relatives over. They got one of those six-foot sandwiches,
and got my brother a day pass out of rehab
and now he’s missing and the sandwich is missing, and
they’re probably in Mexico by now. So humiliating.
Yeah, but this was supposed to be my break, okay?
People were gonna see me in this show and it
was gonna lead to bigger things. More auditions, more parts.
Now none of that’s gonna happen.
Unbelievable.
Then what did you mean?
I think you meant that you don’t believe in me.
I want you, right now, to give me your 100%
honest opinion.
Do you think I have what it takes to really
make it as an actress?
So you think I’ll be on TV and in movies
and win awards.
Yes, honestly.
How could you say that?
Oh.
No, please. Don’t stop, go on. Tell me how I’m
gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life.
Wow, thank you.
You didn’t get your part cut.
And you didn’t get your part cut. Yep, bunch of
old guys rocking out in a band, all with erectile
dysfunction, you didn’t get your part cut!
We can, but the part of Penny might get cut.
Thank you.
Are you serious? For what?
What? How did you manage that?
Come on Leonard, this is just a PR stunt.
Really, let it go.
Hey.
Look, I know you were just trying to help with
your Star Wars thing. I didn’t mean to call it
idiotic.
Oh. Sorry, I meant to. Anyway, um, I was just
upset with myself. I wasn’t mad at you. I just
feel like everything is falling apart.
No, it’s not okay. Look at me, okay? I took
a temp job as a waitress forever ago, and I’m
still doing it. I can’t quit, because guess what? I
can’t do anything else. And I finally get my big
break, and it goes away. I’m such a mess.
Really? ‘Cause this morning at Starbucks, a pair of old
underwear fell out of my pant leg. And it wasn’t
the only one in there.
No, it’s not, okay? I’ve been out here for, like,
ten years. I’ve nothing to show for it.
You’re right. I do have you. Mm. Let’s get married.
Ooh. Leonard Hofstadter, will you marry me?
Did you seriously just say um?
Okay, so, so you don’t want to marry me?
No, forget it. I take it back. Offer’s off the
table.
I’m gonna go.
No, no, I just need to be alone.
Hi.
Look, I’m sorry I didn’t text you back. I just
needed some time to think.
Yeah. Come in.
Leonard…
Listen, I don’t want to break up with you.
Yeah, I probably wouldn’t.
Look, you did the right thing last night. I was
a mess. I was just frustrated because my career is
going nowhere.
Great, because I’ve been thinking, if I really want this
acting thing to work, I need to focus all my
energy on it. And to do that, I should quit
waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory.
I know.
I already quit.
Oh. Hey, Sheldon.
You okay?
Why are you sitting in the stairwell?
Oh. Well, good boy.
Oh, I have a ton of errands to run. I
need to make copies of my headshot, send them off
to agents and sign up for a new acting class.
Okay. You want to come with me?
Come on, boy. Come on. Let’s go. Let’s go. Get
in the car. Come on.
Hi. What’s up?
Actually, I’m at The Cheesecake Factory.
Yeah. I’m just returning my uniform.
I didn’t get it.
Do you think quitting my job was a mistake?
No. I’m serious.
Because Leonard just pissed me off. Am I being an
idiot or not?
Really?
Thank you. I needed to hear that. Why can’t Leonard
understand it?
Yeah, I need to start cracking the window when I
leave you in the car.
And hold three, two, one. Very good. Now let’s try
Warrior 2. And hold.
Yeah, well, I don’t think we’re gonna get to do
that today.
And now we go to Reverse Warrior.
I’m helping him relax because, unlike you, he supports me.
Sheldon, take a break.
Okay, if you support me, what was with that phone
call?
Oh, so now I need your permission? Would you have
asked me before you quit your job?
Yeah, well, maybe we do.
Okay, wait. What are we doing?
Look, I know you think I’m being reckless, and you
might be right, but I need to take this shot.
You keep saying you’re on my side, but you don’t
act like it.
Well, it’s scary for me, too.
Okay. Thank you.
What’s going on?
Oh.
This is a whole lot of weird before coffee.
Yeah, this is not gonna be enough coffee.
To be cool? Yeah.
Oh, guys, this is really sad. And in a different
way than it was twenty minutes ago.
What? You were all going as the Hulk?
And we’re back to the first kind of sad.
I can’t believe Leonard is spending hundreds of dollars on
scalped tickets.
Yeah, but those tickets only get him into Comic-Con. That
dress gets me into anywhere I want.
Yes, like a museum, but anything else.
Oh, all right, if we’re gonna be fancy, I should
probably put on clean underwear.
No, we’re gonna stop at Target on the way.
I can’t believe we thought this would makes us feel
grown up.
Well, there’s a bar in the lobby.
So, afternoon tea was a bust.
Let me ask you a question, when did you guys
start feeling grown up? ‘Cause I am not sure I
do.
Okay, so I’m an adult, and the other day I
saw an old man slip and fall down, and I
laughed. I mean, I laughed hard. Like, like, out loud.
If he was conscious, he would’ve heard me.
I know. One of the tennis balls came off his
walker and bounced right off his head. I mean, I,
I almost wet myself. I guess you had to be
there.
Okay, sex is not what makes you a grown-up.
Really? Is that how you talk to your mother?
I mean, really, what’s so great about being grown up?
I’m serious. Who wants to do all that stuff? Have
insurance, pay mortgages, leave one of those little notes when
you hit a parked car.
Oh, come on, it wasn’t me. Anyone could have knocked
your mirror off, or whatever happened.
No, I think we’re just gonna have a quiet weekend
at home.
That would really piss me off if I didn’t have
a buzz going on.
You have Valentine’s plans? Which came out sounding way more
surprised than I meant. Here, let me try that again.
You have Valent… See? I can’t do it.
Yeah.
Hey, same goes for the two of you with Amy.
Happy Valentine’s Day.
Don’t be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and
three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out. It
came that way when I bought it.
Aw, jewellery. Oh, my God, Lakers tickets?
Aw. You are the best boyfriend ever.
Should we take this little party to the bedroom?
Oh, that’s true.
That is the least sexy thing anyone’s ever said to
me.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates. That’s really bad for dogs.
We gotta get her to a vet right now.
Okay. There’s one not far from here. Come on. Let’s
go.
A whole box.
So the point is I may have saved her life.
Uh, something like this. I don’t know. It came free
with a full tank of gas.
Do you know how much gas is?
Sorry.
It wasn’t cheap. It was free.
Yeah, we weren’t even out of the room that long.
I think there’s something going on between the two of
them.
Yeah, for future reference, that’s a while.
I don’t know. I’m kind of hungry.
Oh. Okay. Oh. Oh. Hey.
How is everything?
Oh, good.
Yeah. I’m sorry if you didn’t think we were taking
it seriously. We love animals.
No.
Hi. Sorry I’m late, I was at an audition.
How about instead of assuming I failed, you ask me
how it went?
Just shut up.
No, no, no, stay there. I’m fine on the floor.
Yeah, you guys never use that space up there. Why
not get a table?
Translation?
Ooh, this one looks nice.
Why not?
Yeah. Well, Sheldon’s not here.
All right, sweetie, you’re paying for this table, and it’s
your apartment, too.
No buts. You got to stop letting him boss you
around.
See? Right there. You’re a grown man, you should be
able to pick whichever hobbit you want. Wish you wouldn’t,
but one problem at a time.
Really? This one?
Give it a chance, Sheldon, you might actually like it.
Well, you can’t say he didn’t give it a fair
shot.
Come on, that is ridiculous.
That’s not what I’m saying.
Yes.
Me?
Are you gonna let him talk to me like this?
Okay, I have not tried to change Leonard. That’s just
what happens in relationships. Look how much Amy’s changed you.
Oh, please. When I first met you, you were incapable
of touching another human being. Now you’re holding hands, you’re
going on dates, you even made out with her on
a train.
Of course she told me, it’s the most interesting thing
that’s ever happened to her in her entire life.
Or you’re the frog who’s been kissed by a princess
and turned into a prince.
Oh, Sheldon, wait.
Yeah, mm-hmm. Amy, it’s Penny. Hey. Just a little heads-up.
Leonard bought a dining room table. Yeah. Sheldon’s breaking up
with you.
Well, I’m glad you’re still together.
You know, my aunt changed her diet, and in a
few months, she…
Sheldon, Amy, will you please come join us?
Yeah, let’s go.
Forget it, Leonard. It’s over.
Aw, thank you.
Well, I’ll have you guys know I turned down a
part in a movie last week.
Because it was crap. It’s a sequel to that awful
killer gorilla movie I was in.
Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one.
They just try to clone me from my corpse, but
my DNA gets mixed with the ape’s DNA and I
end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet.
Well, I don’t think it’s the kind of part that’s
good for my career.
Okay, I don’t think Meryl Streep ever had to say
“Must keep gorilla hands from killing again!”
Oh, I’m sure he does it out of love. The
same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my
life choices.
Oh, it’s no problem. Is everything okay?
Remember the old days when I would’ve said something dumb
like why? Uh, that doesn’t sound good.
Yes.
Yeah, I know it’s on, Sheldon. Oh, no, no, no,
no, no. I cannot afford this right now.
Oh, hi.
Not great. Can I talk to you for a sec?
I don’t know what to do. My car threw a
rod and it’s totaled. I can’t afford a new one,
I have no job, and now I can’t drive to
auditions.
I did. I called them. The part’s gone. They gave
it to someone else. Now that girl’s gonna get discovered
and become famous and go on Letterman and talk about
how she got her big break on a cheap monkey
movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath
her.
How? Unlike me, you have a job. I’m just gonna
have to go back to being a waitress, like I
will be for the rest of my life.
I’m sorry, is the fact that my life’s falling apart
interfering with your board game?
Yeah. Why wouldn’t I want to get my old job
back? It’ll be fun to see everyone. I haven’t talked
to them since I said I quit, see you at
the Oscars, bitches. Come on, let’s just get this over
with.
I know. Thank you.
It’s just so humiliating.
Sweetie, I know you’re trying to make me feel better,
and I love you for that, but it’s making me
feel worse, and I kind of hate you. This isn’t
your car.
I don’t understand.
I don’t know what to say.
Oh, my God.
I wouldn’t be so sure about that.
Sheldon didn’t heckle him?
Disgusting. Do not tell him.
Oh, my God, you guys need to do something!
Oh, my God.
Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend
to be dead all night?
Are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch
of lame characters with silly accents?
You’re right, I’m sorry. Sounds like fun.
That kind of actress. This sucks.
Got it. Hey, who’s the murderer?
Sorry. Hey, who’s not the murderer?
Ooh, I’m gonna check the fridge, and see if there
are any clues inside a beer.
Okay, can I ask you something? Why do you like
making us do this stuff?
I’m gonna need another clue.
Well, my beer isn’t flat and my rack’s not saggy.
So far, the future’s great.
Hey, I’m a famous actress living in London.
Hmm.
Of course not. If I became a famous actress and
had to move, you would just come with me.
Yeah, but if I become a successful actress, we wouldn’t
need the money.
So, wait, if my career took me somewhere else, you
might not go?
Really? You think I’m putting this body through three kids?
Okay, if you do something cool in science, you might
change the world. If I become a famous actress, I’m
not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best.
They just are.
In 20 years, who knows what’ll happen with any of
us?
You do?
That’s so sweet.
Ah-da-da-da-da, let the dead man talk. So, why do you
think that?
Aw, Stuart. Now I feel bad for murdering you.
Oh, come on, don’t pout. I’m sorry I ruined your
game.
Definitely.
I love it.
Yeah, me, too.
Yup, we’re all in.
Hi.
I killed it. I was even able to cry real
tears right on the spot.
I know. Next time I get pulled over for a
speeding ticket, here come the waterworks.
What is this, my first day?
Yeah, sure.
I’m gonna go with monster. What do you got?
I’m liking my odds here.
No.
Oh. Why didn’t I put money on this? Hey, that’s
my agent. If I got the part, it’s still the
second best thing I’ve heard all day. Hello?
No, I didn’t get it.
I kind of did. The part in that awful horror
movie I passed on came back around. Apparently, it’s mine
if I want it.
I don’t know what to do.
Okay, it’s not me, right? This script is terrible.
Okay. Sometimes I feel like I can control the killer
gorilla instinct inside of me, but then I see these
bananas and I just want to eat them and then
kill people. What am I gonna do?
No, come on. This is serious.
Less than I was making at The Cheesecake Factory.
She’s thinking of taking a job at The Cheesecake Factory.
Okay, look, here, page 58. I oil-wrestle an orang-utan in
a bikini.
Both of us.
Okay, like what? Show me.
Oh, that’s sad.
Wow.
Huh?
Really?
Unless you’re sleeping with one of them, seeing other people
isn’t a big deal.
No.
Come on, really?
Well, I’m having an impossible time getting my career off
the ground, and I got offered a role in this
crappy horror movie, and I just don’t know if I
should take it.
I wouldn’t exactly call Star Trek embarrassing.
Me, either.
Yeah, beam me up. I love it.
That’s what I’m afraid of.
No. Did you figure out what you’re gonna do about
the two girls?
Yes.
Great. Not like regret at all.
Hey, you’re up early.
I told you those Walking Dead pillowcases were a bad
idea.
Is something bothering you?
Oh, come on, try me.
Okay. I get it. I mean, not all the jibberjabber
in the middle, but I know what it’s like to
put your heart and soul into something and get nothing
out of it.
No.
No.
No. I’m saying you and string theory sound like a
relationship, and I know what it’s like to be in
one and realize it’s never gonna turn out the way
you want.
I’m talking about other guys.
You have to have the courage to end the relationship.
You know? Break it off, shake hands, walk away.
I know it’s hard, honey, but in the end, that’s
how you grow.
Oh my God, I do look like that.
So, how do you want me to cut it?
Or I don’t cut it and maybe just style it
a little.
Can you keep him quiet? Maybe jangle some keys in
front of him?
Oh, Leonard was telling me about dark matter, but I
didn’t really understand it.
Okay, what do you think?
Doesn’t it?
I gave him a new look. It’s cute, huh?
Wait. What’s wrong with geology?
Like you could get a brown bear.
Who’s the duchess?
Sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new?
I mean, why don’t you take your time, enjoy your
freedom? Maybe something new to study will find you.
Okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?
And you wonder why other children beat you with books.
Cheers!
So, we’re about to shoot this scene in the movie
where the killer ape DNA is slowly taking over my
body.
But I realize they’re gluing fur everywhere except my cleavage.
So, I asked the director why and he says, it’s
important to the story that my boobs be the last
things to turn ape.
Oh, and there’s not even a bathroom on set. I
have to go to the gas station across the street.
I mean, I was dressed like half an ape and
still not even close to the most disgusting person in
there.
Sheldon, what did we say about being a nicer friend?
Leonard, what did we say about being a gullible weenie?
‘Cause you’re trying too hard. You need to do something
else, get your mind off it.
Hey, that’s good. Why’d you guys stop doing that?
Yeah. Sounds like me. Come on, Sheldon. What do you
say?
I don’t know. What do you want to do?
What can we do that’s free?
Are you kidding? That’s what you always do. Think harder.
Uh, tell me more about this calzone idea.
No. Bernadette’s working late.
Come on, anything can happen. We can push him down
the stairs.
Yep.
What the hell? What? She’s not working late.
Why would they lie to us?
You’re not working late. Why did you lie to me?
I haven’t been complaining that much about the movie. Have
I?
Well you know what? Maybe I need a break from
all of you. Come on, Sheldon.
We’re gonna have Anything Can Happen Thursday, you’re gonna tell
me all about your science stuff and I’m gonna complain
about my movie, and we’re gonna support each other because
that’s what friends do.
Shut up.
What’s wrong?
It’s fusion.
Think I’ve been complaining too much about the movie?
Thank you.
Hey, I don’t understand why you’re not upset with Amy.
Thank you. Hey, maybe the answer to your career question
is in one of these.
Come on, open it. I bet it says something great.
Fine, I’ll go. Hmm. People turn to you for guidance
and wisdom. Yeah, that’s a good one.
How is that not good?
Uh, since you’re paying for dinner, I’ll let that slide.
Open yours.
Not with money. Read.
Oh, try again.
Oh, I think I see our next stop.
No, come on, tonight we are trying new things.
All right, Sheldon, just ask your question.
Oh, for God’s sake. Look, he’s a physicist who’s trying
to figure out what his next field of study should
be.
Okay, I can answer that one, I’ll be bored.
Oh, oh, here we go.
Yes, yes, your spirit guides are on fire.
Oh, he does. He so does. What should he do?
Sheldon, do you hear that? I mean, Amy is the
key to your happiness.
Wow, you really struck a nerve. I’ve never heard him
use the M word before.
What? That’s a real thing? What is it, Star Wars
Christmas?
So, when is it?
Oh, no. This face wasn’t because I didn’t get it.
Hey, guys.
Okay.
No, thanks. Leonard and I are just going to the
funeral.
Oh, I get it, like C3 PO. What happened to
me?
Sweetie, are you sure you don’t want to come with
us to the funeral?
No, he blew up the Death Star. Why do I
know this?
Oh, like Attack of the Clones. We are leaving right
now.
I have a confession to make.
I’ve never been to a funeral before.
I just never knew anyone that died. I had a
pet pig when I was a kid. I mean, when
he died, we didn’t have a funeral, we had a
barbecue.
I didn’t know him very well, but I still really
liked him. It’s weird that he’s just gone.
I feel like I want to cry.
I can’t do it with you staring at me.
No, I’m dry. You’re a big crybaby, you start, I’ll
join in.
Toy Story 3?
It was a gift. Thank you for being the emotional
one in this relationship.
Yeah.
Well, I don’t want to be a jerk, but it
was kind of a bummer.
You think about dying?
What would you regret?
You know Klingon.
No, I meant that as a regret.
What’s that?
Well, it just wasn’t the right time.
And this is also not the right time. Do not
propose.
I know that face. That’s your propose face.
What’s two to one?
Oh, my. It’s not a contest.
Okay. Fine. Would you feel better if I propose so
you could turn me down again?
Okay. Leonard, will you marry me?
No, don’t you dare. You reject me right now and
tie things up.
This isn’t funny anymore. Just say no so we’re done
with this. Will you marry me or not?
No.
You know what? Fine. Do whatever you want.
Thank you.
Yeah, he is pretty stupid.
Hi.
Uh, pretty good, actually.
Oh, no, it is, but I decided instead of complaining
about it, I’m just gonna go in every day and
give it my all.
Thanks. There’s no reason why I shouldn’t be the best
bisexual go-go dancer slowly transforming into a killer gorilla anyone’s
ever seen.
Go away. Just go away.
What gave you the right to mix my DNA with
that of a killer gorilla?
Life? What life? Look at me, I’m a monster. And
now I have blood on my hands, or paws. I
don’t know.
I love you, too. But I’m afraid I love killing
more. Like, one day, I might actually try and kill
you.
Actually, you know what? Can we do one more? I
think I could do it better.
Well, I care. I mean, look, if we’re gonna do
this, why not try and make it something we’re actually
proud of?
You can’t do that. He’s with me.
What? You can’t fire me. I’m the star. I’m the
girl that goes bananas. It says so on the poster.
You know, the only thing worse than doing a movie
where they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting
fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to
your ass.
Yeah, well, it’s easy for you to say. You used
to be famous.
All right, I’m sorry, you’re famous.
God, what am I doing with my life?
You were on set, you saw what it was like.
Oh, really?
It was over a bowling alley.
Are you done?
It was for haemorrhoid cream.
Leonard, you are really not cheering me up.
Hmm. You think you’re five-foot-six, that’s funny.
Oh, my God. What a day.
No. I need to start making some smart decisions.
With my life.
I don’t know. We could get married.
I am.
Well, yeah.
What? No, that’s not what I’m saying.
What does it matter? The point is, I’m choosing you.
Sweetie, you can be any pastry you want.
You know what? Forget it. I never should’ve brought it
up.
Okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from
that movie was the best thing that could have happened
to me, okay? I finally realize I don’t need to
be famous or have some big career to be happy.
You, you stupid Pop-Tart.
Really? You guess you’re in?
Okay. Leonard
Yeah, I think so.
What’s wrong?
Yeah, it kind of does, huh?
Where did you get a ring?
Oh, my God, yes.
You’re right! Yay!
No, Mom, it’s the same guy I’ve been going out
with for the past two years. Yeah, the scientist. Well,
it’s complicated. I mean, he works with lasers and atomic
magnets. No, I did not see it coming. No, we
did not set a date. No, I am not pregnant.
Yeah, this is a first for our family. All right,
tell Dad I love him. I gotta go. All right,
bye.
Shut up.
You want some wine?
I think Leonard’s mom’s okay with me.
Well, haven’t really talked about it yet, but I figure
at some point, I’ll move in with him, or he’ll
move in with me.
Not a chance.
No.
Okay, then, yeah.
No, keep your money.
This is so sweet. You never cook for me.
If you don’t like my cooking, why haven’t you ever
said anything?
Sorry. I’ll get better.
Well, I’d like to pick one that works with my
brother’s schedule.
Uh, 12 to 18 months from now, depending on good
behaviour.
Well, Leonard cooked for me and now we’re just having
a nice dinner, you know, as a newly engaged couple.
Amy, get out.
Oh, I’m sure he’s fine.
How?
You do that?
He can take care of himself. Look, we went over
stranger danger and gave him that whistle.
What?
So? He loves trains.
It’s sweet how you look out for him. You’re a
good guy.
We were worried about you.
And go where?
Leonard, hang on. Just come here. Maybe we need to
let him go.
It might be good for him.
He’s a grown man.
Leonard, we can’t protect him forever.
He’ll be okay. You taught him well, Padawan.
Seriously, let him go.
Be safe and call us.
Mm.
I really think this is gonna be for the best.
