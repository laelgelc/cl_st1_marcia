Oh, hey, where you been? We've been calling you for
hours.
Why?
Yeah.
What?
(chuckling)
Congratulations!
I can't believe she tried to steal Sheldon from Amy.
So, how are you guys doing with all the new
events in your womb?
I know you guys are freaked out, but you're great
parents, and if you ever need help, we are here
for you.
You guys were just saying how freaked out and miserable
you are.
Yeah, if we're gonna have a baby it's gonna be
when we are ready, or when I'm certain Penny is
gonna leave me.
Uh... Surprise.
No. Wait. No.
Well, you know, Bernadette and Howard are pregnant again, and
Amy and Sheldon are getting married. I didn't want you
to feel left out.
So do you not want the cake?
Oh, crap, it is our anniversary.
Hey.
Ooh, nice.
Hard to say. Tell us about Princeton.
Not-- well, we'll catch up later.
Oh, I've got something. I'm being interviewed on public radio
this Friday.
Uh, the university is trying to get more funding for
the physics department, so they want me to go out
and talk it up.
Thank you.
Thank you for having me. Whoa... Could never get used
to hearing myself in headphones. Is that really how I
sound?
That is good to know.
Wow, that's hard to say. There's so much going on.
We've been collecting tons of data that could revolutionize the
way we understand the universe. For instance, there's a particle
called a squark, which could prove supersymmetry.
What, the squark?
No, no. Wouldn't that be exciting? But we're also looking
for the selectron, the gluino and the neutralino.
No. Another fun sidenote -- I went to high school
with a girl named Theresa Gluino, but it didn't cost
$2 billion to find her. She was smoking behind the
gym.
Uh, nothing, actually.
Although, some days I'm, like, ugh... we've spent so much
money. Why haven't we found anything? What are we doing?
Hey, guys.
What? You got something to say?
Look, I-I was just speaking the truth. We're scientists-- isn't
that what we're supposed to do?
I told you that in confidence!
Uh, can we just drop this and have lunch like
adults?
What?
Ms. Davis, you wanted to see me?
Should I sit or stand? I'm not used to being
called into the dean's office.
I have to say I'm a little nervous.
Look, I know I screwed up, but it was only
one interview. How much damage could it have caused?
I didn't say it was a dead end. I just
said that I was worried it might be.
Light-headed, and glad you asked me to sit down. Okay,
just tell me what I can do.
You want me to lie.
Really?
What if it doesn't?
No one would talk to me in the halls. They
just glared at me. It's like high school all over
again.
No. I got called in to the administration office.
We don't technically have a principal. There's a standing committee
that oversees the budget.
I may get fired.
Yeah, who wouldn't want to hire the physicist who publicly
said physics is dead?
I can fix it, I just need to write a
retraction I don't believe in-- basically sell out to keep
my job.
Sheldon, it's me.
Come on, don't be like that.
What?
Well, that sounds awful. Now I get why everyone hates
me.
Oh, yeah, you did.
Mm, given I might be unemployed, bittersweet.
Oh, hang on. "Yes, one might question the $20 billion
to build and run the Large Hadron Collider, but on
the other hand..."
This is depressing. Do you have any alcohol around here?
Isn't that just vodka with blue dye in it?
I was, but we're both depressed, and decided to drown
our sorrows.
It was briefly legalized during the alliance between the Romulan
Empire and the Federation at the time of the Dominion
War.
I-It's worse than that. It hasn't found anything in years,
so we don't know if we're right, we don't know
if we're wrong. We don't know where to go next.
No, we don't need to be cheered up. It just
turns out that physics is exactly like Lost. Started out
great, and turns out just a big old waste of
time.
Physics is all we're cut out for. I mean, if
we weren't physicists, w-what would we be?
How?
Mm. Are we running there? Because watching drunk Sheldon run
would be the highlight of my life.
Feynman was so cool. When I was a kid, I'd
put on some headphones and crank up one of his
lectures and just... jam out to knowledge.
He did so much. And here we are, stuck and
letting him down.
He was right. Physics is only dead when we stop
being excited about it.
Oh, hi, you wanted to see me?
I sent you an e-mail?
Oh, it's coming back to me.
Any chance that's the end?
I-I can explain. I...
Ooh, you could get married at Comic Con.
Long time.
By the way, congratulations again on your engagement.
Well, Sheldon's a complicated man.
Give him a brain scan-- that might be a tumor.
I choose to believe you.
Mm, it's true-- Freud thought dreams were about s?x, Adler
thought they were about dominance...
Well, now it's just edging into mockery.
That is crazy.
Have you played this for him?
If you want me to object at your wedding, just
give me one of these.
Oh, yeah, I see it.
Look, hang on. Doesn't this girl get a word in
all of this? And isn't that word "no"?
Yeah, and if something grows out of it, just worry
about it then.
It's okay. We're all here to help.
Uh, she can pee into a bottle.
Come on. You can build things. You were an astronaut.
Back to the dry cleaner. Look at this. They didn't
get the stain out of my Starfleet uniform.
Nah, it's worth it.
Oh, too bad. She just missed me!
I was worried you might not check your e-mail.
That one was not me.
My mother's texting you?
Why? She sick of talking to the magic mirror on
the wall?
Okay, just be careful. You think you're getting close to
her, and the next thing you know, you're featured in
a book called He's Doing It On Purpose
Really?
Well, that's great. Never told me she was proud of
me. Even when I stayed dry for a whole month.
Well, let's be clear. I-I married you to hurt her.
You're kind of ruining it.
Hey.
You got a sec?
Penny's been talking to my mother like they're best friends,
and it's kind of freaking me out.
Oh, really? Is she FaceTiming with you right now? Because
she's FaceTiming with my mom, and believe me, that is
not a face you want to spend time with.
Penny doesn't know how manipulative my mother can be. Did
you know there's such a thing as reverse, reverse, reverse
psychology? Because... there is.
And why is my mom proud of Penny and not
me?
I'm good at stuff, too!
Okay, well, thanks.
Hello, Mother. How are you?
I'm great.
Wait. Hang on. We need to talk.
I want to know, why aren't you proud of me?
No, that is a question-- and I ask it a
lot-- but let's stick with the one I asked you.
Because you never say it. But two days into chatting
with Penny, and you can't stop telling her how great
she is.
Seriously?
So, Penny's your favorite?
I don't... I don't... I don't know what to say.
Thank you.
Yeah, here it comes.
Yeah, no problem.
Hey. Tha-That's an Ewok and it's mine.
Good, because I just bought another one on Amazon.
Hey, what you reading?
Oh, my God. Are-are we...?
Well... You're sitting there with a book. It felt like
anything was possible.
Yeah? Anything interesting?
Hey, Sheldon, what's up?
It's fine, I've been driving him for years. What's one
more day?
Kill me.
I don't know. Uh... French police?
Let's take a little... little break, I'm getting a headache.
Yeah, weird. So... Howard and Amy working together-- that's interesting,
huh?
You're not jealous of Howard, are you?
Train.
I'll give it a go. My ride home with you
was hellish.
Well, then out you go.
What did you do-- Are you a witch?
That's amazing.
Take him to the zoo and leave him there.
Ahh, Sheldon's texting me to drive him to Bernadette's.
Well, they did just introduce the middle finger emoji. If
it's not for this, I don't know what it's for.
Worth a shot.
Well, sometimes, but... problem for another day.
All right, I'll give it a try. "I can drive
you in two hours or you can take an Uber"
Huh. He's gonna take an Uber.
Unless he bites the driver, yeah.
know what? This is crazy. Howard and Amy are working
together-- get over it.
"Knowing when to say when." This is not a big
deal.
You can't think this is the right time to "validate
his behavior."
What about you coddling him and he's never gonna learn?
Thank you. Wait, no, no. Don't use that book on
me.
Penny's been using one of Bernadette's parenting books on you.
Your shampoo comes in a Big Bird bottle.
Well, you can't end a sentence with a preposition, so
clearly, not grammar.
That depends. Before I said it, was s?x tonight still
on the table?
Then it's fine.
What surgery are you having?
Oh, me, too. I grew up watching his show. He's
one of the reasons I became a scientist.
Joke's on you. It worked. Have they found anyone to
replace him?
Who do you think it should be?
You should put that on your audition tape.
Sheldon, uh, I thought it, uh... It-it looked like you
were having so much fun.
Hey!
Do you remember when you were a kid and you'd
watch Professor Proton?
Well, did he ever make you-- I don't know-- hate
science and the people who do it?
I-I just think it would be... better if your contempt
for children wasn't so much in the foreground.
Hey, you can always reshoot it.
Oh, boy.
They cast the new Professor Proton.
Not exactly.
It's Wil Wheaton.
Would you ever get a vasectomy?
You okay?
You know that's us, right?
What about tiresome lunatic with a bad haircut? Has he
called yet?
Isn't the important thing that there's a show to get
kids excited about science?
Because he makes no sense? Yeah.
Oh, I think I'm...
Sure.
Hey, Bert. How you doing?
Yes.
What do you think?
Trust your gut.
Sheldon, what are you doing? Bert's one of the top
guys in his field.
Hey, buddy, what's up?
Just a minute, I want to make sure Leonard can't
hear us. I've got a box of cupcakes. Okay, we're
good. I'm working with Bert, but I don't want anyone
to find out.
Hey, how's Bernadette handling bed rest?
Then why does it say, "Property of S. Cooper. Stop
touching it"?
Sheldon, that was pretty rude.
Bert asked for my help.
Look, Sheldon, you were a jerk to Bert, and he
walked away from you. So I feel like there's a
lot he could teach me.
So you just shut the door in his face? I
got to start writing this stuff down.
Well, according to his text, he was on the second
floor, then he stopped to tie his shoe. All tied,
and...
It's the greatest scientific feud of all time. I mean,
you can forget about Leibniz and Newton.
Tesla was a genius who invented our electrical grid. Edison
just wanted to get rich and famous.
Edison was kind of a publicity hog and a bully.
Really? Should've been about Samuel Morse the way they telegraphed
that ending.
Yeah, I'd appreciate it.
Yeah, sure. Oh, hey, the guys and I were talking
about going to see the Tesla coil at the observatory
later on, if you want to join.
Why? What are you doing?
What does that mean?
Hold on, are you still working for the military?
Well, you better not be working on our project, because
we're a team.
I don't know. Target practice?
Why don't we call Colonel Williams and find out what's
going on.
Hey, is Sheldon working on our project again?
But our team developed that technology.
We can have "take charge" attitudes.
We didn't want to step on anyone's toes.
No, no. I am taking charge right now and telling
you that it is not okay with us if... Okay,
bye.
Hey. We talked to Colonel Williams.
You know what, you like to think that you're just
like Tesla, but the truth is you're exactly like Edison.
Yeah.
Let's not forget your idea was based on my theory.
Be even better if he swapped out the helium for
xenon.
And xenon has a bigger nucleus, so coherence would make
it an easier signal to see.
We should tell Sheldon.
All right, you're right, you're right, we don't need him.
We can do this all on our own.
No. But if someone else does it, I can double
check the crap out of it.
Oh, he's just helping us develop a better, more efficient
neutrino comm system that we're gonna pitch to the military,
making yours obsolete.
Oh, thanks. You see, instead of using liquid helium...
Right, sorry.
Oh, well...
Based on Kripke's calculations, I think this is gonna work.
Maybe we should pitch it to Colonel Williams today.
Without committing criminal espionage?
What are you talking about?
Excuse us. Kripke.
No, it's your fault. If you would've come to us
in the beginning, none of this would've happened.
She's right. Maybe we're all a bunch of Teslas after
all.
He did fall in love with a pigeon.
What are you talking about? You love that movie. You
even went as Avatar for Halloween.
Hey.
Wait, didn't we mine some a few years ago?
No, we-we definitely mined some. I-I remember sitting in your
bedroom and writing the program. I think we ended up
with a bunch of it.
I can't believe we forgot about it.
I wish I knew how much we had.
Penny and I just started dating, and you know I
don't like big crowds.
Terrified.
Well, I didn't want to say it, but I-I do
like to hear it.
Maybe we should double date. I'll bring Penny and you
can bring your mom.
Hey.
If it's not tangible, how do you know it's not
just gonna vanish tomorrow?
Mine it? Like, mining gold?
Staying up late, writing code, it sounds like a party.
All right, so just the four of us.
Great, so just the three of us. Oh, yeah. We
did it without you.
The day we found out we're rich and none of
it is yours?
So what are you gonna do with your share of
the money?
How about you?
Wow, you were really into Asian science.
Do you know a mining song?
Aw, man, what happened? It crashed. It's been doing that
lately. I think it's got a virus from all the...
music I've been downloading.
Well, we can use my laptop.
Actually, a cookie sounds good.
That's right. It must be on my old laptop.
Hi.
No. We-we could be sitting on a fortune.
Damn it, it's not in here.
Sheldon, you can't still be mad.
Sheldon, please.
Hey.
Yeah.
You having a good day?
You know what, if you need a computer, you can
use my laptop.
Oh, it's fine. I-I'm getting a new one anyway.
So you know where it is?
Great!
No!
I can't believe you took a gift from me and
gave it to another man.
You know, Penny and I aren't the only ones who've
broken up. So did Howard and Bernadette.
I'm not mad.
Fine, I'm mad. I guess I was more upset by
our breakup than you.
Didn't seem like it. You started dating the first tall,
handsome hunk you could find.
Hey, Zack.
So do you have it?
Huh.
You should be. We were broken up for, like, five
minutes.
No.
Sure. Because we're both... people?
Wow.
Aw, you love me so much.
I know, and not just out of pity like everyone
said in their wedding toast.
Totally. That's my wife.
Got the laptop.
Hey, when we sell the Bitcoin, are you gonna pay
your dad back all the money you took from him
over the years?
Yeah, how much is in there?
What? Th-That's impossible.
What?
Where's our money?
Sheldon... I lost that key chain years ago.
Heck, yeah? Looks like someone need to put a dollar
in the almost-swear jar.
Why not hexadecimal?
Hey.
Well, I'm excited for you.
Yeah, you would've been perfect for it.
Yeah, you don't want to do that. Talking to my
mom to get more confidence is like talking to a
lion to get more alive.
Well, that makes sense.
Well, Howard does make fun of him a lot.
Well, I'm not surprised you think so.
Well, you can be kind of mean to me.
I got a few rounds left in me.
That is a trick question. The answer is
Hello.
One of us should go sit with Raj so he's
not alone.
You're right. Go on. Okay, well, first, I'm going to
try to get Amy to trade with me for hors
d'oeuvres...
What happened? What's wrong? Just tell me. I can take
it.
Oh, okay. Sorry. I wasn't ready for it. Try again.
Nope, still freaking me out.
Hey, what's going on with your hair?
That's amazing!
Mm, don't you think it's time you two made up?
Hey, I talk to you about science all the time.
I'll catch up with you guys.
Hey. What are you doing all the way in the
back?
This is ridiculous. You guys are best friends. Of course
he wants you here.
You sure? He seems to be doing pretty well without
me.
Look, he was just stressed out. His life is not
better without you. Come on. Come say hi.
And why are you reading Aquaman?
The dinner thing. The Aquaman thing's dumb.
Isn't Halley's birthday the same as Amy's?
Hey.
Really? Is this still happening?
Uh, who wants to go see Last Jedi again tonight?
Okay, that's enough. This fight either has to end or
get way more entertaining.
Hey. What you reading?
Ugh. If there's a picture of his wife and his
kids and his dogs and his horses all in matching
pajamas, I beg you to burn it.
It's just his chance to brag about how great his
life is.
Look at me. I built a hospital in Rwanda.
Hey.
Sure. What is it?
I assume like the rest of frontier life, it'll be
exhausting and short.
Oh, I've decided to write my own Christmas letter. So
I'm gonna make a list of all the cool things
we did this year.
Yes. Can you think of a single cool thing we
did this year?
Sure. I mean, my Air Force project got taken away,
and you're not crazy about selling pharmaceuticals. I'll just write
down "still employed." Oh, we had our second anniversary.
Great. Okay. Okay, that's a start. What else?
Let's look at our pictures; that-that'll jog our memories.
Oh, uh, that's a mole on my back. I wanted
to make sure it wasn't growing.
Sheldon took it. We're kind of mole buddies.
Memorial Day?
Oh. That's the great thing about California; you can almost
go to the mountains and almost go to the beach
in the same day.
Morning.
No, the fern. The one in the bathroom.
Oh, couple hours. I took a break to try to
beat my high score on Mario Kart.
Do you see it on the board?
I think so, too.
I guess it feels like everyone's moving forward and we're
stuck.
Well, we've been married two years. Should we think about
what's next? Like buying a house or having a baby?
Okay, like what?
No, no, I-I'm serious. If there's things we want to
do, let's start doing them.
I would love that.
It's just a day trip, but we could take the
ferry out to Catalina.
Bernadette still going stir-crazy?
You'd either have to break your hip or let Howard
knock you up.
Oh, oh, I'm starting a book.
I do. It's something I've been thinking about for a
long time.
It's not about you.
Doesn't matter. This is fine.
Oh, nice.
Why can't Amy drive you? Because of the tradition that
I cannot see Amy on the day of the train
store sale.
Please, please see a doctor.
Is it getting hot in here?
Oh. Sheldon gave me a brain teaser. It's kind of
fun. It's about a group of people at dinner, and
you have to figure out where they can sit without
fighting.
Yeah, did Sheldon send it to you?
Really?
Did Sheldon and Amy give you guys that puzzle, too?
I don't think they're acting.
Yeah, same.
Yeah, me, too. But-but Cinnamon ate it. I-I'll get it
back tomorrow.
And I'm in last?
You know what, this is so insulting. I-I don't even
want to be your stupid best man.
Oh, my God, Dr. Purple's a woman! Of course! Oh,
that feels so good.
Look, this is your wedding, just pick whoever you want.
You don't need to worry about anyone else but yourself.
You've kind of been training for this your whole life.
Hey, what you making?
Oh. Yeah. I'll just have the mac. "Nothing" gives me
gas.
Mm, I just talked to Sheldon. He apologized about the
tests and asked me to be his best man.
Sounds like you care.
You okay?
Stuart, I'm sorry if it's weird Sheldon made me best
man instead of you.
Newspapers? Did you find a portal back to the 1990
s?
What are you doing?
Boy, you'll do anything to avoid reading.
That's great, Raj. Congratulations.
Oh, well, good for you. You know, Bert and I
have started isolating zircons from meteorites for our dark matter
search.
What have you been working on these days?
Where did what come from?
I just asked what you've been working on.
Yeah. We were just about to watch a little TV.
You're welcome to join us.
Well, actually Amy came back over and we hung out.
Did you know that we're both spelling bee champs? We
stayed up for hours trying to stump each other.
Oh, she thought she had me with "appoggiatura," but I
shut that down expeditiously. E-X-P-E-D-I-T-I-O-U-S-L-Y. Expeditiously.
At, like, 9
Hey.
Too bad, you guys kill at bar mitzvahs. And other
events that people can't leave.
I guess he forgot that I play the cello.
Okay, I think it's ready.
Well, the funnest fun is the safest fun, so yes.
Hi.
Well, Amy and I were talking about old science fair
projects, and how fun it would be to recreate them.
Mm-hmm. It's pretty cool.
Yeah. Turns out we both did this as our science
fair projects in ninth grade.
Check this out.
Mm-hmm. The crystallization is an exothermic process, so the ice
is actually hot.
So did I.
Oh, hey, in seventh grade, I built a cobra wave.
You want to do that?
I'm sorry, we-we don't have to do more experiments. Let's
do something we can all enjoy.
Are you sure? Yeah, you're having science fun, and I
don't want to interfere, or watch you.
Now let's calculate the amplitude!
So, I think if we want to predict the height
of the wave, we need to use elasticity theory and
model the lattice as one continuous flexible piece.
Mm-hmm.
Except now if I eat paste, it's because I want
to, not because Craig Schultz is making me.
Is it, "Where was the teacher?" She was in the
bathroom smoking, that's where.
Oh. Uh... not really. Sorry. That probably wasn't the answer
you were looking for.
Mm-hmm. You do remember you're here because he kicked you
out of your apartment?
Thought you were getting us dinner.
That's cute, but you can't have knots in more than
four dimensions.
I'm looking at my shoes. This is making me a
little motion sick.
That pause gets longer every show.
Uh, you can turn it off now.
Aw, that's great.
No, on your phone it's cute, on my phone it's
a crime.
Please don't let it be you and your dog in
the bathtub.
Oh, good for you. H-Hey, w-what's the Hindi word for
"dog"?
You kutta.
Sorry, he's a kutta, you're not.
Okay, the next dr?g is Romatrol.
Uh, correct. And who can it be prescribed to?
Right again. And what are the side effects?
Mm, remember the mnemonic.
Oh, uh, so close. It's actually yellow discharge.
Hi.
Maybe he's experiencing memory loss because he took...
Yeah.
Uh, Sheldon, what are you doing?
No.
No.
No.
That is our room now, and we're gonna turn it
into a gym.
No.
The answer is still no. You can say we wouldn't
know you're here, but we'd know. Because you'd be here!
What the hell? What are you doing here?
Do something.
Sounds good, do that. Yeah...
So you can just walk in any time of the
day or night?
Okay, I-I-I'm really uncomfortable with him back in that room.
Y-Y-You don't get it. All the years that we lived
together, he drove me crazy the whole time.
Exactly. Don't look at me like that. It-it-it means he
did it on purpose. It was a choice. That-That's like
finding out Godzilla could've had Arby's instead of Tokyo.
Not my point. Sheldon. Sheldon!
No, you're being perfect and you know it.
No. Yes. What...? Stop messing with me!
Sorry, I just, I had to get out of there.
I know how to deal with Sheldon being Sheldon, but
Sheldon being a-a rational, thoughtful person? I'm clueless. I-It's like
when my mom called last year to sing happy birthday
and I-I just threw up.
I made a deal with him, and besides, that wouldn't
be fair to you.
Well, great. Tell him he can come back.
That's what he's doing to me, too, the jerk! Stop
that.
Hey, Sheldon.
Hey. So, your contract provides for a three-day trial period,
and I don't think this is working out. So, to
put it in legal terms, the party of the first
part would like the party of the second part to
get out.
12
Eastern Standard Time.
This is just a-a bunch of paper. You can't enforce
this.
This is not happening.
Well, apparently he's not leaving and I have to go
get him sparkling water.
I don't know. It just feels right.
Hi.
Oh, it's my new keyboard. It looks and sounds like
an old-fashioned typewriter. It makes me feel like a real
novelist.
Apple juice.
But unsweetened, like Hemingway used to drink.
Uh, good. I just wrote the part where the hero,
hotshot physicist Logan Dean, arrives at CERN.
Uh, kind of. But he can eat dairy products without
having to leave the room.
Hmm. Uh, believe me, that is a plot point later.
Thank you. Oh. Oh! I just thought of the murder
weapon!
No. That's way better.
And then, when the lights come back on in the
supercollider room, Dr. Logan Dean makes two important discoveries
And murder.
Well, Logan's actually based on me.
Well, I have to finish writing it before they can
make it into a movie, and I still have a
few things to figure out.
Hi.
What's he forgiving you for?
It doesn't.
What? What? Which part?
Got it.
Yeah?
Oh, great. Me, neither.
What character?
No, it's not.
Trust me, that describes more women than you think.
It's murder.
Okay, no need to be snarky.
Could be anyone. Dr. Silvers. Dr. Prekash. Hans the janitor.
But the door is locked, so it has to be
someone in this room.
Maybe it is a little like Penny. Any chance she'll
be flattered?
Ilsa or Penny?
So, what do you think?
But adorably mean, like a baby lion?
Huh. And who do you think that is?
But the door is locked, so it has to be
someone in this room.
Oh. Y... Bernadette. Yeah, sure.
Each one of you had a motive.
He did.
It's not massive. It's just average-sized.
I have an alibi.
It doesn't say "glasses."
But it will, because Ilsa does. And you know who
else wears them? Bernadette. And-and that's her, cause it's, it's
totally, it's totally her.
Sorry. I didn't get my PhD in quitting.
Everything you do hurts.
Hey.
What are you talking about?
Wha...? That is crazy. You-you two are totally different.
I mean, I-I didn't intend to write about Penny, but
I guess maybe subconsciously I did.
Yeah, sure. You know, it would be nice if you
didn't correct me all the time.
What do you mean?
Got to go.
Oh, Penny, good news. It's not you.
Ilsa. It's not you. It's my mother. I've been writing
about my mother!
It's not massive. It's just average-sized.
Everything you do hurts.
I-- M-Maybe I do.
You know what? I'm a physicist. What am I writing
a book?
So, any day now.
Why are you smiling?
Whatever you're doing, it's not bragging.
Hey.
You should not.
Oh, we can hang out and keep her company.
My mother believes that if you're not prepared mentally, it
can delay your body from going into labor.
Raj is crazy. Your ankles aren't that gross.
Sheldon texted and said Bernadette wanted us all to come
over.
Yeah, that's a kid who's gonna take his mother to
prom.
Some people name their kids after places.
Go, go! Save yourselves!
Sorry, can't have it. That's my boy name.
It's not like calling dibs.
Remember that day you moved into the building?
A non-creepy amount of time after that.
That was five hours ago.
Yeah. Hey, what'd you name him?
Yeah-- where's Howard?
Why would we high-five that?
Hey, guys.
Do you guys have a location yet? because you don't
have a lot of time.
Hey.
Y-Yeah, look, about that, I lied.
Mm-hmm. I avoided him and impressed you, all with the
same lie.
Hey, I-I just, I wanted to apologize about the Athenaeum.
I don't know. It just seemed funny at first and
then the longer it went on, funnier it got. So,
yeah, I guess that's why.
Come on. I-I do feel bad. Why? Did your best
friend hurt your feelings?
What?
That's actually one of the nicest things you've ever said
about my work.
Hey, Kripke.
Why are you cleaning that out yourself? Don't you have
grad students?
Fair enough. Uh, so, look, I'm here to ask you
to give Sheldon and Amy the Athenaeum for their wedding.
Because deep down, Barry, you're a really good guy.
Fine. What's it gonna take?
Because deep down Barry is not a good guy.
Yeah. I made a deal with him to get you
the Athenaeum for your wedding.
Because I was a jerk for lying to you before
and besides, you're my best friend. I want you to
have the wedding of your dreams.
Okay, I want Amy to have the wedding of her
dreams.
No, it's okay.
Well, what are we going to do?
You know what? You're right. If we work together we
could totally outsmart Barry Kripke.
Why do I have to be Robin?
And he gets to bring a date.
Well, um, you know how Barry has the voice of
an angel?
Oh, "Volare". That's what he was saying. Boy, I didn't,
I did not get that.
Wait, what? I scrubbed sludge for you. I may be
slightly radioactive.
Sort of like Sheldon's knock.
I believe they do text him. The-the Bat-Signal is linked
to his phone via Bluetooth.
No, it's just what I believe.
You sure? I-I bet his Internet's really fast.
No... what are you doing?
So you're gonna spend a day with Bill Gates. I'm
a little jealous.
Well, if you're nervous, I-I know a lot about him.
I can fill you in or maybe come along, whatever.
Well, I'm-I'm just saying, what are you gonna do when
he wants to talk about high-level language interpreters for microcomputers?
A way of programming computers using words and commands instead
of binary code.
Oh, well...
I didn't even see it coming.
Well, I-it's just, he's an idol of mine and I
would love the chance to hang out with him.
I get it, I get it. You're right. Actually, I've-I've
already met him once before. He gave a talk at
Princeton and my mom took me.
He's super nice. I-I got pretty emotional and started crying
and... He didn't make fun of me or anything.
Uh-huh.
On a Sunday?
You're right. Guys, this is her job. We need to
respect that.
Proud of you.
For Penny to walk down the stairs, get in her
car, and drive away.
She's pretty quick, let's go.
Th-This is a bad idea. Maybe we should go.
I don't know. I'm just feeling guilty, like I'm kind
of sneaking around behind Penny's back.
No, this is wrong, let's go.
Uh, M-Mr. Gates, I'm-I'm Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. We've actually met
before.
You were so nice, a-and it was really special to
me because you've been such a big influence on my
life. I mean, ever since I was a little kid,
I've looked up to you like-like a hero.
Uh, hold the door. Hold the door!
Didn't you hear me yell "hold the door"?
No one says that.
Actually, I met Bill Gates.
It's not an April Fools' joke, Sheldon. I actually went
to a hotel and met him.
Why is "went to" in quotes?
It is.
No.
Well, he's probably still there.
The La Quinta Inn in Thousand Oaks, under the name
Hernandez.
April fools.
Hey.
Uh, just hanging out with the guys.
Uh, they were, but then I was like, "Hey," and
they were like, "What?" and I was like, "You know,"
and they were like, "Okay."
Well, it's not for me to say, but you just
said it, so you're probably right.
What?
Wait, what do you mean "again"?
Yes. And then again tomorrow, for a total of two,
and only two times.
Yeah, I wonder that, too.
It's not fun, I'm screwed.
I snotted on his tie.
Where you going?
I want to, but I'm just too sick.
I know. And I've been trying to hide it so
I could go, but I don't want to make him
sick.
Yeah. Have fun.
No, that's just my regular pale and clammy.
Whoa. Oh, oh, oh, oh! In your face! Hello?
Okay. I'm just resting.
Oh, really? Yeah, look who's here.
No, you don't.
I am so sorry-- Sheldon?
You got beaten up by a girl.
You're right. You got beaten up by a baby.
Hey. What you got there?
But yeah.
Oh, it is. I had one the other day.
That is the danger of a restaurant on wheels.
Who would complain about something that everyone loves? Oh... Did
you complain to the tenants association about the food truck?
You're the tenants association?
And the noise complaint we got for singing you "Happy
Birthday"?
Well, if you can vote yourself in, then we can
vote you out.
When is that?
Okay, fine. Then we vote you out.
I move for a vote of no confidence in the
president. Yeah. Two to one, you lose.
Yeah, we're waiting, neighbor who needed a battery and totally
got one from me, no strings attached.
Can't believe my best friend is Sheldon. Ah, I should've
taken that gavel and shoved it right down his throat.
Even when he's being crazy?
Yeah, principle. And a little bit sandwich.
Sometimes you don't see it because she's next to Sheldon,
but she's pretty weird.
Hi. We're your neighbors from downstairs.
Welcome to the building. Mm-hmm. So, I-I'm running for president
of the tenants association. I could really use your vote.
Oh, really?
So, I'm running for president of the tenants association and
I could really use your vote.
Yeah. You just need to show up at a meeting..
No. Vote Leonard.
Hey, Sheldon. We found something pretty interesting.
Turns out, when Amy took over Penny's apartment, she was
put on the lease, not you.
So, looks like we need to figure out who the
new president should be. I nominate myself.
Think about Ant-Man
Michael Douglas had the suit and then he passed it
on to Paul Rudd.
Yeah, thanks. I-I know that's hard for you.
I think I've made a huge mistake.
Aw. Remember when he used to get that excited to
see us?
Wait. Robert Wolcott? Like Wolcott's Theorem Wolcott?
So you're gonna go to the middle of nowhere and
spend the weekend with a crazy man you've never met?
No reason. Have fun.
What? He said it.
What are you doing?
Don't look at me. When the music stopped, you were
holding Sheldon.
When I said you should make a playlist for the
road trip, I meant music.
As Sheldon's best man, I need to inform you that
this is not a bachelor party.
Because you're a tiresome scold.
How is that not exactly what I said?
Uh, how come he gets to whine?
Mm. That was a lot of knocks-- they were made
for each other.
Mm, you have-- but you were worried you'd spend too
much time in it.
It's a sort of grin. You want to know what
kind?
Oh. Why?
Wait a minute, are-are you saying that time has multiple
dimensions, the same as space?
I could spend months up here just going through his
math.
Hey, I drove.
Oh, uh, Sheldon's getting married in a month.
Oh, really? Is she here?
Yeah.
No.
Okay, please don't tell me you want to live like
this.
This one's more of a professional model.
When was he in your store?
What about Wonder Woman's bracelets?
What is it?
That would be so cool.
What?
Sheldon.
Neil Gaiman.
Not us.
Hi.
Wow.
Well, you both discovered it. You can put both your
names on the registration form.
Why not?
Well, he is the one who knew it was a
comet.
Uh, he didn't mean monkey.
And she didn't mean that. Actually, I think she did.
You should go.
I know, but on the other hand, do you really
care?
No, I'm not saying anything... ever again.
Oh, well, what was it?
I know you're right, but he is our friend, and
this could be good for his career.
Ah, there you go. Everybody wins.
Why would I want to make anyone angry?
Oh, I am on your side. Hey, hey. Let's not
forget who you're really mad at here-- Raj. Oh, and
Paul. Paul sucks, right? But don't tell him I said
that.
Raj, just help me out. Penny's pretty mad about this
comet thing.
Oh, come on, you know she was a part of
it. Just add her name to the registration.
I guess you're just gonna have to swallow your pride.
Sure you can-- just pretend it's two or three doughnuts.
I told you that.
No, no, don't get upset. You're not a bad person.
Just let me... talk to Penny. I'm-I'm sure I can
make her understand.
I went to yell at Raj.
Interesting thing.
Maybe I did, or... maybe I did. But I did
realize something. I-I don't need to fight your battles. You...
you are a strong and independent woman. You have your
own voice. And, to quote another strong woman, Katy Perry,
it's time to hear you roar.
What do you want from me? The song was on
in the car. But it doesn't mean that it's not
true.
I know I don't say it enough, but you go,
girl.
What-what are you doing?
You're in a stolen cop car with a dead hiker
in the trunk. You don't have to obey traffic laws.
Your theories are pretty abstract. I wouldn't even know how
to design an experiment to prove them.
I guess you could create a contained microscopic black hole.
He said no?
Yeah, you-you just have to be patient.
I would not.
Hi.
No. I'm just sitting here at my desk typing on
my computer for nothing.
Do you really think people are gonna give you half
a billion dollars?
"For $50,000, I will examine your diet and create a
customized bathroom schedule." That's fitting-- 50 grand down the toilet.
Aw, and all these years, I've been getting that for
free.
How's the fundraising going?
Wow. That's a lot.
Well, don't give up. You'll find that money somewhere.
No, but it's good that he has a hobby.
Um, it is the worst idea, and I'm including the
year that Raj wore nothing but tracksuits.
No one is going to Vegas.
Last time I saw Sheldon was this morning.
No. There-There'll be a lot of single people there. Stuart,
Amy's great-aunt... Although, Stuart's already friended her on Facebook, so,
better move quick.
Uh, I'm-I'm afraid that ship may have sailed.
Yes.
Well, he laughs at his own jokes, but otherwise he's
okay.
Sheldon, you tried. What more could you have done?
Really? I've never heard you mention Adoot.
Look, uh, short of getting on a plane and flying
there, what does your mother expect you to do?
I kept saying no. H-H-How am I here?
So, wait, y-your brother is Dr. Tire?
We passed three of these stores on the way here.
Why did you say he's just "some loser who sells
tires"?
Oh, excuse me. Uh, we're looking for a Georgie Cooper.
I'm also a doctor. Do you want to wait in
the car?
I wanted to wait in California.
So, is this Georgie?
I don't know, small leak?
All right, that makes sense.
Hey, I'm Leonard. I'm here for-for no reason.
He's not that kind of smart. You might want to
give him a hint.
Not helping, Sheldon.
Sheldon, come on.
No, not too mean, not too good either.
What'd she say?
Say that to her on the wedding night. Really spice
things up.
Sorry. I know what it's like to live with a
bully.
Oh, I was talking about Penny, but sure, yeah.
Well, look, we don't fly out until the morning. Why
don't I try and talk to him, give it one
more shot?
What?
Wow. That was impressive.
Yeah, that guy's the... Actually, I don't, I don't know
who that guy is.
Come on. I-I know you two have your differences.
Well, not everything. You're both tall, you have the same
last name. Maybe I shouldn't have started this like it
was a list.
Ooh, there-- that-that was very Sheldon. Look, I-I'm sure he
was not the easiest brother to have, but it wasn't
easy for him either, with you picking on him all
the time.
Well, what about the time you threw away his Halloween
costume?
Madame Curie?
Well, didn't you sit on his head while he tried
to watch Star Trek?
That is pretty hilarious, yeah.
Yeah. I've done all that. I've also removed all the
red balloons from his Lucky Charms because they weren't "Irish
enough."
Not in so many words, or any words.
No. No, it wouldn't kill him.
Danke schon? It's, uh, "thank you" in German.
Nope.
If it makes you feel any better, my mom's most
proud of Sheldon, too, so...
Yeah, I would love a beer.
Thanks. Can you open it for me?
I know.
Sheldon, you need to apologize to your brother.
Yes. Like that, but nicer, and that way.
Yeah, this is good. Get it all out.
Is it me, or did we just patch a tire?
I'd say no, but what's the point?
You mean the Balrog?
Really? Why?
You know, Amy still does some performing. She and Sheldon
do an Internet show about flags.
No. I'm just so happy for you. And for me.
After today, you are officially-- and, more important, legally-- Amy's
problem.
Oh, of course.
Everyone's waiting. What are you guys doing?
Super asymmetry? Is that a thing?
Don't you think this can wait until... Hold on. This
is interesting.
Uh, according to Google, there are zero papers that mention
super asymmetry. This is brand-new. No one's thought of it.
You don't understand. This could be really big.
Yep. Thank Wolowitz. He set it up. Thank you.
Save something for the honeymoon.
