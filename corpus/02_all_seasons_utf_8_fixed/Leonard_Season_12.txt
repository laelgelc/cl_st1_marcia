Ha, ha, she called your bluff.
Oh, that's great.
Meryl Streep and Cher? Yeah, I saw it.
They're not; they just posted a picture in front of
the Statue of Liberty.
Lego.
Okay, let's go into our apartment. We'll lock the door,
we'll call the pol...
Was it? I-I honestly can't tell anymore.
Didn't need to. The sequel stands on its own.
Uh, hurry. Raj is on next.
This is the news.
Either that or the Big Bad Wolf.
I don't think he's in there. I mean, he came
by to water the imaginary plants, but then he left.
All right, but I'm telling you he's not in there.
There. See?
He wears Axe body spray.
Ah, shouldn't we mind our own business?
To be fair, we don't know either of you. Satisfied?
If you let him talk, maybe you'll find out.
All right, well, you know who doesn't need to stay?
Us. Come on. Penny, come on.
Poor Mr. Fowler, I really feel sorry for the little
guy.
Look at you retaining facts from a nature show.
Some guys think strong women are sexy.
Yeah, well, sometimes opposites attract.
I don't know, maybe a little.
Morning, sunshine. So I see you're making espresso.
Really? I don't, I don't think you do.
I-I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.
It's not true. Mrs. Fowler is an angry, vindictive woman,
whereas you are warm and-and loving, quick to forgive.
Hey, I-I don't think you're scary. Yes, I flinch when
you make sudden moves, but... ...that says more about my
childhood than you.
Aw. Did you forget about us until you were at
the airport?
Oh, good. You guys liked it?
Do you not know what it is?
He-He's never gonna figure it out.
Gosh, this makes me happy.
Aw. Does he know what it is?
So, so happy.
Oh, I-it's just this dumb crystal wand that Howard and
Bernadette gave us for our wedding. Penny and I made
each other miserable trying to figure out what it was,
and we thought, "Why not pass that fun along to
Sheldon and Amy."
That was in a lost and found box?
Oh.
I'm no longer happy.
Well, I don't know, w-we're pretty happy here.
Really? I always figured we'd get a place with a
yard.
You were there. I wore her down.
I just don't think you can truly know someone until
you've spent a lot of time with them.
Uh, Malibu beach house.
That's Barbie's dream vacation. Maybe you should send us that
questionnaire.
Well, I've spent a lot of time painting D&D miniatures.
I know that makes you want to rip my shirt
off, but wait until your nails are dry.
Oh, it's Raj. He sent us that Indian marriage questionnaire.
Okay. "How religious are you?" That's easy, both of us
Great, so your church is Our Lady of the Stretchy
Pants. Next question. Uh, "how close are you with your
family?"
I'm gonna say not too close, but I'm hoping to
get farther. How do you feel about children?
W-Why would you throw a rock at a child?
The question is would you like to have kids. So,
yeah, we want kids.
Right, like, in the next five years.
"How are you with pets?" Well, I did take care
of Sheldon for 15 years, and he only bit me
twice.
I didn't think it was.
What are you talking about? You married a woman you're
in love with.
How does that help? Oh, it helped me. I've been
trying to slide that into a conversation for years.
Yeah?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, are you pregnant?
So?
Oh.
Ever?
Sure. Sure. Sure. And I guess it would be hard
raising kids in the-the loft you never told me you
wanted.
I'm not mad. Why would I be mad? There's nothing
to be mad at!
I knew that!
I'm not mad!
Sorry.
Got a lot on my mind.
Not really.
It's just Penny hit me with some pretty big news
and it's a lot to process.
She said she doesn't want to have kids.
Forget it.
Well, I always assumed we would and now I find
out, you know, I might be the last of the
Hofstadter line.
I'm going back to being quiet.
Hey.
Thank you, but you don't have to do this. I'm
fine.
Really? We're joking about this now?
I-It just took me by surprise. I-I always imagined having
kids.
But I've imagined having a lot of things that I'm
never gonna get
Yeah.
I am.
He might feel differently. Bye.
Are you gonna tell me where we're going? Because if
it has the words "farmers" or "market" in it, I
don't want to go.
Oh, my God. You bought me the Batmobile?!
This is amazing. Thank you.
Come on, Robin!
Was that the imaginary talking koala?
Yeah, so did the koala.
I wonder if it'd work a second time.
I still can't believe Sheldon had a best friend we've
never heard about.
I'm not jealous.
All I'm saying is you know the timing of a
fellow's bowel movements, you don't think there's a lot left
to discover.
Really? You have George's number?
So, what happened?
Well, I mean, Sheldon never talks about him. They haven't
spoken in years. He wasn't at the wedding.
Oh, he still does.
Bye.
Oh, great. What did he do?
Oh, come on.
Won't that make Sheldon mad?
Not Tam.
Not Tam.
Tam Nguyen?
Well, if you mean physically, yes.
Uh, no. He-he didn't come. He's, uh... he's still pretty
upset about... you know.
Come on, you-you must know.
Why did you and Sheldon stop being friends? What did
you do?
Oh, hey, Sheldon. We just met...
Hey. What is going on with you?
Well, I'm sure you have a perfectly stupid reason.
You know, I was curious to find out what Tam
had done wrong. Why am I not surprised the answer
is nothing?
Be careful, Sheldon. I don't think you can afford to
lose a second best friend. I don't see anyone lining
up to be your third.
Uh, I'm Leonard Hofstadter. I called you about the apartment.
You said...
Sounds like Penny and Bernadette had fun last night.
Yeah.
I'm glad you guys made up.
Cool.
Sure. Shall we?
No.
What were you guys giggling about?
Oh-ho, love notes?
Penny, I'm... Late for that thing. See you.
Oh, Sheldon. Didn't see you there. What's up?
Sheldon, we've talked about this. You can't go around boring
other people's wives.
Yeah, you do.
Well, she does have her own job.
Where you going?
If I had a nickel for every time a charity
sent me a nickel.
If my father's any guide, around 50, I start to
lose my hearing and get two new jokes. Hey.
But you have one, don't you?
And he'd be right.
Well, then, you just walked up three flights of stairs
for nothing.
No, it's actually three.
The lobby's the first floor, so lobby, second, third, fourth.
And if it makes you feel better, Penny and I
will come so you'll have a couple of friendly faces
in the audience.
Hey, Raj, if I had a nickel for every time
a charity sent me a nickel...
I know.
It's three, right?
What is she ta...
Did you know the Michael Myers mask from the film
was actually a Captain Kirk mask turned inside out?
Says the man with a giant belt buckle and a
dickey.
Hey, if you really want to dress up, we could
throw a party.
All the time? I only remember being invited to one.
Okay, so, Friday night-- Halloween party here.
Are you gonna dress in drag in front of your
fianc e?
Yeah.
Oh, my God, you look amazing.
Sheldon, he's being you. He's dressed as you for Halloween.
Hey, happy Halloween.
No. Sorry, you're not wearing a costume.
I'm gonna need more.
Go nuts.
So, what are you wearing to the party? Sexy cat?
Sexy nurse? Sexy zombie?
Say that again with this helicopter on my head.
Hey, do you remember what happened at that first Halloween
party that you invited me to?
More memorable than that.
We had our first kiss. On this very couch.
No, no, it was on Halloween, and you felt bad
for me.
Never mind.
No. Of course not. No, we just remember different things
from that party. I remember falling in love, and you
remember vomiting in a pumpkin.
Oh, that's great. He's a Supreme Court justice, and you're
the U.S. Constitution.
So, here we are. On Halloween. On this couch. Does
it ring any bells?
I'm just surprised you don't remember our first kiss.
Are you agreeing just to shut me up?
Okay, guys, I think that's enough.
It was. And I'm sorry about earlier. I know it
doesn't matter.
Why didn't you just say that?
I like that. We'll make that our official first kiss.
What are you still doing here?
That's what you said about the butterfly pavilion at the
zoo.
The rest of us are pitching in with hammers and
nails.
President Siebert, you wanted to see me?
You sound like my wife just before she asked me
to go to Coachella.
More fun than heatstroke? Good luck.
Really? W-Wow, what an honor. Thank you. So how do
I decide who gets the money?
Yeah, right, sure. Uh, so, after I decide, do I
then submit it to you for approval, or...?
That's a lot of responsibility.
Thank you. I-I'll get started right away.
I will keep you posted.
Gentlemen.
Mm, possibly.
Well, Siebert put me in charge of handing out the
last bit of the administrative funds, and I have sole
discretion.
Uh, hold on, I'm not just gonna hand out money.
There's a procedure you need to follow.
Cute, but President Siebert trusted me with this, and I'm
taking it seriously. If you have a legitimate request, you
can submit it to me in writing, and I'll evaluate
it based on its merits.
Of course.
No, I'm not going to reconsider. Your request was denied.
I don't care if it helps you think; you don't
need a koi pond in your office. Well, you should
have thought about that before you bought the koi!
Well, I have to be. Everyone assumes I'm just gonna
give them whatever they want.
No, I'm not. I mean, look at this. An espresso
machine? I don't think so. Denied!
Really?
Well, check this out. A standing desk. Denied!
If you want to stand, do it on your own
time, because I'm the boss.
Hey.
What do you want?
Nice try. The answer's no.
Denied!
I did, and your research is fascinating. I had no
idea that crows were that smart. Do they really hold
grudges?
Well, l-look, I only have enough money to fund one
request, but your project is definitely in the running.
Um, soon. I've narrowed it down to three projects.
Actually, yeah. The software in the telescope room hasn't been
upgraded in years, and it seems like it might be
time.
I'm not just giving it to my friend, Barry. Your
proposal is also in the mix.
No, because they wrote detailed proposals, and you sent a
YouTube clip of the guy from Jerry Maguire saying, "Show
me the money!"
Look, all three of your proposals have a lot of
merit. I just want to make sure I'm making the
right decision.
It doesn't help.
Okay, I-I just-- I need everyone to back off. I'm
in charge here, and I'll decide when I'm ready to
decide.
A day, a week. I don't know!
I don't know that either!
I'm reviewing these proposals.
It's just so hard! All-all three of these proposals have
merit. How do I choose?
There has got to be a right decision based on
empirical evidence. Look, I made pros and cons lists, and
then I came up with three different scoring systems to
determine the best project. I just don't know what scoring
system to use. So I'm working on a meta-scoring system
to score the scoring systems, but the math is really
complicated. You want me to walk you through it?
So, I've narrowed it down to three worthwhile projects, but
I only have the money to fund one of them.
Lucky for you, I have a solution.
You free up more money and I fund all of
them.
Or-- hear me out-- yes. That way, e-everybody's happy.
I think I can.
Well, actually...
Okay, what would you do?
That's a really good id-- Oh.
Sorry. I'm distracted.
No matter who I give the funds to, someone is
gonna be upset with me.
Of course.
No.
How do you not care what people think of you?
Wait, you can make this decision. You don't care if
you upset people. You can pick for me.
Oh, great.
Sheldon, come on.
Yes.
I'm sorry, Raj.
No.
I did not.
There were. But, at the last minute, someone submitted an
application for a pretty cool europium-doped laser, and they made
a very compelling case.
Oh, that it was me and I wanted it.
Uh, it turns out I can, and I did.
Well, I realized that, no matter what decision I made,
people were gonna be mad at me. And this way,
I get a laser.
And I don't care.
Yeah, I do. The europium laser is so cool. It
has a four-level f-f transition which provides for high power
output, and its quantum efficiency is off the charts.
I have no idea.
I see it.
It has a tag on its leg.
Smart. Let's stand perfectly still and...
Three months from now? No.
I mean, secret romantic plans that would be ruined if
I told you.
Penny, you will never guess what I have planned for
Valentine's Day.
Yeah. And my mom loves Penny, which is weird, because
I never knew she could love.
So now I have to sit on the floor? It's
my house. Why can't Sheldon sit on the floor?
Hi.
Uh, hang on. I'm about to beat Howard. What? Hey!
Do you know how creepy that sounds?
So, is this the first time?
How you feeling about it?
Just don't put so much pressure on it. It's always
a little awkward in the beginning. I remember the first
time I slept with Penny.
Oh, it was awesome! I will replay it in my
head until the day I die.
Did she?
Ah, I'm just reflecting.
The first time we slept together.
Yeah. O-One sec. W-What do you mean, "don't beat myself
up"?
Totally understandable. I'll ask again, what do you mean, "don't
beat myself up"?
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, nothing. He just concocted some stupid test to see
if I can keep a secret.
I'm not gonna tell you that. The test is stupid,
but I still want to pass.
Well, I am shocked, Sheldon, because I totally believed that
the woman you reported for being stingy with the peas
couldn't keep her hands off you.
I didn't really believe him.
No.
You mean the last two minutes or the last years?
Well, you've certainly gone about it the right way.
That's busywork. Can't you just get a grad student to
do it?
Y-You know what? Sure. The three of us in the
library looking up old papers-- that actually could be kind
of fun.
It just got more fun.
Thanks for helping with this.
My friend sent me down to this basement to do
his grunt work, so I wouldn't know.
Yeah, uh, that's not true. That's just something Sheldon made
up to test us.
This is a list of the papers we need to
pull. Why don't we split up? You take half, I
take half.
Come on, Raj, it's just a library.
F-Fine, how about we split up but we stay in
constant communication with each other?
Still here.
Still here.
Too much dust.
Pretty good. I'm just looking through "The Effect of High
Energy Muons on Proton Pion Scattering at the National Accelerator...Laboratory."
No, this actually makes it more exciting. We have to
get through all of this before I run out of
this.
Why did you pull this Russian paper?
Mm, it's not translated. Maybe we should talk to Howard;
his Russian's pretty good.
W-Wait, so Amy and Sheldon weren't the first to think
of super-asymmetry?
Okay, well, they might need to rename their theory "The
Cooper-Fowler Gregora-poli-popivich Theory."
Sheldon is not gonna be happy about this.
So this disproves their theory?
Oh, how are we gonna tell him?
You did find it.
Okay, okay, h-how about this? We all tell him.
You guys are such cowards.
Oh, hey. I just need to give Sheldon some bad
news, and I really don't want to.
No, I-I found a paper that proves their theory wrong.
They thought this was gonna be their Nobel Prize. It's
gonna break his heart.
Why wouldn't you just tell her that?
I-Isn't it better to get bad news from a friend?
All right, a-all right, here I go.
Why?
I didn't hear a podcast.
Actually, I-I need to talk to both of you about
your paper.
Well, Raj and I were chasing them down like you
asked us to, and, um, we came a-across a, a
Russian paper that seems to disprove super-asymmetry.
Yeah, uh, Howard translated it. I'm so sorry.
So what are you listening to, This American Life?
No, I tried calling and no one picked up.
I-I also texted to see if he wanted to go
to the new Fantastic Beasts movie and he didn't respond.
No, it's not.
I-I think it's Gregora-poli-popivich, but...
What are you doing?
Let me try. You-you guys can't just give up. Uh,
individually, you are the smartest people I know. Together, you
can do anything.
Is there anything we can do?
Oh, yeah, it's our dinner. I mean, it's your dinner.
Hey, how's it going?
So we have made a list of subjects for everyone
to avoid.
Asymmetry.
That also applies to The Simpsons, Simba from The Lion
King, and cymbals.
Uh, also no talk of Rocky IV.
Chicken fried steak.
Hey, you knew I was a bad boy when you
married me. Come on, you want a piece of this?
Me. I'm not sharing the steak.
That's a good point.
No, it's not.
It's that bad, huh?
I have something that might help. It's-it's a recording of
the only person whose opinion Sheldon actually respects.
No, himself. It's a pep talk he made when he
was a kid. He gave it to me years ago
and told me to save it for a real emergency.
His major export is talking. I didn't want that anyway.
Hello, Mother.
I need your professional advice.
Wh-Why did you just say you're too busy, but...
Oh, boy. He cared about this a lot.
And when I was little and my dog died, my
mom sat me down and very gently told me that
she wished the truck had hit my dad instead.
Sheldon?
Buddy, come on, let us help you.
Look, t-this might seem strange, but, uh, we thought it
might help you get some closure if you had a
chance to properly say good-bye to your paper.
Yeah.
I thought so, too, but my mom thought it might
work.
Wha-- How come when you thought it was my idea...
You mean, like, push it out into a lake and
shoot it with a flaming arrow?
Would you like to say something?
It's kind of beautiful, isn't it?
It's in water, it's fine.
All right. A... a toast to Sheldon and Amy and
the publication of your super-asymmetry paper. We are so proud
of you guys. Cheers.
So, have you guys gotten any feedback yet?
And yet, somehow she soldiers on.
I'm surprised you're interested in some stranger's opinion.
If any of them accuse you of being too pretty,
Penny can help you through it.
Well, what if he's complimentary?
All right, just... let me see it. Okay, this is...
this is really positive. Wow, it's, like, really positive. He
says it might be the discovery of the decade.
Hey, Penny and I were thinking of getting a big
paintball game together.
She doesn't want to shoot me.
Penny.
She just wants to play paintball. It combines my love
of whimsy with her love of making grown men cry.
Hey. We're doing a big paintball game on Saturday if
you two want to join.
All right, we need two teams. Who wants to be
the captain?
Yeah?
First? For a team? What is happening?
Okay. Sheldon, do you want to stay here and...?
Shot at.
Bang, you're out.
I'm not gonna shoot you from right here. It's too
close. It's gonna hurt.
I'm telling you, from this distance it's gonna... Ow See?
That hurt!
No, I'm not gonna shoot you. Ow!
See, I told you it's gonna hurt... Ow!
What is up with you two?
Yes. If you really like her, you can't let fear
get in the way. You have to move forward.
I will let you know.
You've come to a giant metal door.
There are no traps.
Your wizard eye reveals a monster.
I guess.
Okay, the cyclops tells you that the enchantress you seek
is staying at the Inn of the Dwarven Lords.
Oh, off the charts. Literally. Sheldon rolled a number so
high, it wasn't on any of these charts.
How was ladies' night?
Well, it does squeak when you touch it.
Oh. Yeah? How's he doing?
Oh. Well, that's nice.
Huh. And you ended up with me, so everybody wins.
What? Oh, absolutely not. In fact, he should be jealous
of me because I have you. And a dungeon with
over rooms left unexplored because no one thought to search
for secret doors under the wizard's throne.
Really?
Well, I'll get the dice back out.
Uh, do you remember Penny's ex-boyfriend Zack?
No, thank you.
Well, apparently, Zack sold his company for a ton of
money and retired.
I don't know. I mean... I guess so. Yeah. It
doesn't seem fair. I work hard. I'm really smart. I've
made substantial contributions to my field. But Zack gets to
be rich, while I'm still working for a paycheck?
Who's that?
Yeah, well, I don't have to hang out with Gordon
Letwin.
Penny told him we'd go have dinner with him and
his wife on their stupid boat.
Well, then, she'll think I'm being jealous and petty.
That is funny.
Oh, uh, well, uh... Catcher in the Rye.
So, uh, we gonna take this thing out?
Well, it's a beautiful boat.
Are you jealous?
Oh, it's driving me crazy, too.
Yes. I was trying to pretend like it wasn't so
you wouldn't think I was petty.
I love you so much.
Thank you.
Huh. You went to college.
Wow, this is really flattering.
No, I... I got it.
I know.
I... I really don't know what to say.
You know, I-I think we should talk about this.
There's nothing wrong with them.
Yeah. So I'd be helping out a couple who really
want a baby, and they were gonna pay us, and
Penny freaked out about it.
I know.
Yes, Sheldon, they wanted me. I'm smart. I'm nice.
Are you upset he didn't ask you?
Well, he does. I don't see why Penny is so
against this.
Wow, that's really insightful.
Hi.
Where you been?
All right, look, um... I'm sorry that we fought before.
I know this is a really unusual situation, and if
you don't want me to do it, I won't.
Yeah. We're a team. We're in this together.
What is that?
Really? because it looks like the top off the NyQuil
bottle.
All right, sorry. So... are you saying you're okay with
this?
Thank you.
No, Sheldon. Would you say that last part one more
time?
Sorry. What's your news?
Wait, what?
I am so proud of you.
No, I-I mean, I'm proud of how well you're doing
at work. Are you even using soap?
Yeah, I really do.
Well, what are you talking about? If you were in
charge of her project, wouldn't that be a promotion?
All the smart things I say, and you remember the
dumb one.
Look, I-I know she can be difficult, but she's no
match for you. Whatever she dishes out, you can give
it right back double.
There you go.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I-I'm actually one behind.
Ooh, uh, how about this week's Walking Dead?
No.
Come on, there must be something we've all seen.
Mm, actually, the Nobel Committee has sometimes favored experimentalists like
them over theoreticians like you.
No, i-it's true. The scientists that proved the big bang,
they thought their sensors needed cleaning until someone pointed out
that they were picking up cosmic background radiation from the
singularity. They won the Nobel. Not the scientists that came
up with the theory.
Yes.
Excuse me. Remember you all came here to check out
my cool new laser?
The best part is that it's europium-based, so...
Okay. Anyway, so because it's europium-based...
Ah. I'd be happy to.
Cool. I'm gonna stay here and show Howard...
Okay. Well, thanks for stopping by. Screw them. That's cool.
Yeah.
Sorry, I...
Thanks, but I'm fine. I think it's just allergies.
Hey.
Uh, it's just allergies.
Well, y, i-if you want, we could use my new
laser to cut it open.
Well, sure, but with my laser, you'd get a thinner
slice, which would make for a better sample.
Yeah. Uh, so, anyway, you want to use my laser?
Okay. Yeah, that's cool. Just seems dumb to not use
the laser.
Literally nothing.
Uh, he's working with Bert. They're probably cutting their stupid
meteorite open with their stupid diamond saw.
Yeah. I'm just a little run-down. It might be a
head cold.
It's just so frustrating. I-I know my laser would be
way more efficient. They're gonna lose so much meteorite due
to kerf loss.
Don't make it sound childish. It's the scientific word for
dust.
No. It's just, my way is better, but they won't
even consider it.
Ah, it's okay. Stuart gave me some when I was
at the comic book store.
Mm, he's got plenty. His pill caddy is, like, this
big.
No, no, no, you take the bed. I'll stay out
here.
Bert? Raj? Huh. Can't believe they're gonna cut that with
this punk-ass diamond saw. Geez.
Showing you that this is the better way.
What is that?
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just feeling a little... hungry.
What? What?
Oh, thank God. I was eating my friends. Well, one
friend and one acquaintance. You know what, Bert's okay. Two
friends.
Yeah.
That depends. What-what color are my eyes?
Oh, good, I'm awake.
Hey. You guys got a second?
No, I-I just wanted to apologize for yesterday. I just--
I think I was jealous, you know?
Sheldon and Amy might win a Nobel Prize, and now
you guys have this cool meteorite project.
Yeah. I even had this crazy dream last night where
I ate you both.
Uh... I know. I was pretty out of it.
Oh. Uh, you.
Ah, we're happy we can help.
Okay.
Five days? My record is 24 years.
Oh. Then my record is years.
Oh, hey, Sheldon. We're kind of in the middle of
something.
Where? Did I get it?
Thanks.
Oh, what's up?
Yeah, I can't go either. Penny's dad is visiting from
Nebraska, and I haven't seen him for a while.
Oh, vitamins. Zack wants me to take them to increase
my virility.
He may have said "wiener power."
Got it.
I got it.
Is that a sports team?
Hey, Wyatt.
Ah, well, you know, I've been taking vitamins.
How 'bout those Cornhuskers?
Maybe for you. You threw me under the bus.
Well, yeah, now he's judging me.
Well, I-- no, I wouldn't say it like that.
Uh, same words, just less angry.
Thank you.
Okay, look, they can't have kids of their own, and
they like that I'm smart, and they want that for
their child.
No, no, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Uh, you
were comparing me to a prize stud. Go on.
Hey, it's your fault your dad likes me. You dated
idiots your whole life.
Mm. Really?
Wait, wait. I can't. I mean, I want to, but
I'm not supposed to for the next three days.
Really? That's what you're sleeping in?
No.
Penny, I-I know what you're doing. Just please stop.
Oh, hey, guys. Sorry. I used my key. I just
needed a place to crash.
Yeah, I... had to get out of the apartment. My
wife kept trying to have sex with me.
Well, I-I have to go to the clinic for Zack
and Marissa on Monday, and I'm supposed to save myself
until then.
Well, she said she was. But she also said I
looked dope. Honestly, I don't even think I looked fly.
If she has a problem, she should say something.
Penny doesn't want to have kids. I respect that. But
this is my chance to leave a part of me
behind.
Hey.
Uh, Wyatt, we need to talk.
I want you to back off. You know? I-If Penny
and I don't have kids, that's between us. So you
need to stay out of it.
Oh. Okay, you could've stopped me sooner.
Uh-huh.
Yeah? I-I-I felt like my voice was a little shaky
there. Um... Hey, I decided to not go through with
this Zack and Marissa thing.
I know. But, um... I think I was just fooling
myself. I-I would be heartbroken if I had a kid
out there and I wasn't his dad.
Yeah. So, that thing you wanted to do last night,
I'm available.
Hey, Zack. Um, look, I-I know this is gonna be
disappointing, but, um, I-I can't do this. No, no, no,
no. I-I, I know how. I just can't. But, hey,
look, i-if you like, I-I know someone who might be
interested.
Wow. That's a lot of luggage for a weekend.
Was one of the options the option to never come
back?
Doesn't answer my question, but okay.
I love you, too. And you're gonna do great. Just
relax, stay out of your head, and try to enjoy
it.
I still use it. It's a mantra.
Just the weekend. You all heard her say it.
Mm, why not? It counts at Comic-Con.
I don't know. Maybe watch a movie with subtitles.
Checkmate.
They're not our children.
Three guys playing a board game doesn't sound like much
of a party.
Maybe she's basing that on your poor husbanding skills.
Hey. I didn't think you were coming.
What's going on?
I think I can speak for all of us. You're
just creepy.
Wasn't that your nickname in high school?
That is kind of interesting.
Not a chance.
Grab it. Grab it, Halley. I believe in you.
Hey. Hey, y-you guys want to make this more interesting?
There's something familiar about all this.
Oh, my G-- This is my entire childhood.
Uh, it's like word for word.
Is that all I was to her? Just an experiment?
Oh, my God. At sleepaway camp my cabin was called
"Control Group."
Just tell me the truth, Mother. Was my whole childhood
just one big experiment?
So that's all I was to you, a-a test subject?
Really?
When did you stop?
Wow. That's a lot of luggage for a weekend.
Was one of the options the option to never come
back?
Doesn't answer my question, but okay.
I love you, too. And you're gonna do great. Just
relax, stay out of your head, and try to enjoy
it.
I still use it. It's a mantra.
Just the weekend. You all heard her say it.
Mm, why not? It counts at Comic-Con.

Uh, it's like word for word.

Just tell me the truth, Mother. Was my whole childhood
just one big experiment?
So that's all I was to you, a-a test subject?
Really?
When did you stop?
That is Ellen's brand, gotcha journalism.
Hey, what'd I do?
Those guys are good at self-promoting, so what? No one
ever won a Nobel for being nice.
He's right, the Nobel Prize is about the work, and
as your fellow scientists, we support you and Amy.
Uh, that's a great idea.
Uh, no, I just met my exercise goal for the
day.
Hey, you have your goals, I have mine.
Mm, just finishing a workout.
Well, that's-- so you need these people's support and you're
sending them baked goods?
You want to tell me what's going on?
Sheldon, please don't take this the wrong way, but when
you're quiet even for a second, something's wrong.
Well, we all do. But just for fun, why do
you?
Wow.
No-- I'm just honestly impressed. When did you start caring
about other people's feelings?
Or moving forward, you could think before you speak.
But the time machine thing is probably more likely.
Well, uh, if you like, I could try to help
you out. You know, and maybe let you know if
you're crossing a line.
Sure.
How's "shut up"?
Professor Thorne?
Uh, you know my wife, Penny.
Uh, we wanted to talk to you about Dr. Cooper.
Now, before you say no...
Well, then, after you say no.
But more than the person, the Nobel is about the
work. You should understand that more than anyone.
Just give them a chance. Uh, science has a history
of difficult people. Look at, uh, Newton, who was a
jerk to Leibniz, and Leibniz, who was a jerk to
everyone.
You guys deserve this.
Wait a minute.
I can see that.
Kind of like angry chickens. Or-or-or-or like, uh, when-when puppets
fight.
Is this gonna be a problem?
Sheldon. Shut up.
No. Shut up.
Shut up.
Yeah.
You don't know what one is.
Well, I've got him distracted for a while.
Normally, yes, but I switched the stickers around, so... I
don't even think it's possible to solve...
What? No, you didn't.
Top five, not bad.
It really does. Oh, uh, how about a sensory deprivation
tank?
What are you talking about? All you ever do is
complain about how things smell, feel and sound.
I'm not saying this is why we came, but can
I close the lid on him?
Hey, buddy, how you feeling?
Okay, when you say you consoled her, what exactly does
that mean?
Maybe you can't. Sometimes people are upset, and all you
can do is be there for them.
Nothing.
You're up.
No. Th-That's not even close to what-- Uh, you know,
actually, that might be your best move. Yeah.
Oh, the... there's a 7
We can eat afterwards.
Guys, just come on. Make a decision. I-I'm good with
eating after.
Then we'll eat before.
Actually, 3-D kind of makes me queasy.
Okay, then, we'll go see it in 3-D.
Well, I'm doing this.
That's not even a word.
I'm just trying to find a plan that makes everyone
happy.
You know, what would make me happy is if we
just stop talking about this and see whatever movie you
guys want to see whenever you want to see it.
It's better. The throwing up really helped.
Oh, it's okay. Everyone talked about it so much on
the ride home, I feel like I saw it.
I think I would've been okay if we weren't sitting
so close.
Sheldon said, "Are these seats good for everyone?" What was
I supposed to do, say no, like a maniac?
Satisficer?
Uh... according to my mother, I took my sweet time
being born.
Apparently, she had dinner reservations.
Oh, w... when I go upstairs, Penny's gonna make me
choose what we're gonna do tonight without taking her feelings
into consideration, and I-I don't know if I'm up for
it.
I-I've always been a people pleaser. Is that so bad?
It's gotten me this far.
Okay, if I go in there and pick something I
want to do that she also wants to do, she's
gonna think I'm just picking it to make her happy.
So I feel like I have to pick something I
know she doesn't want to do or she's gonna be
disappointed. Right? What do you think?
I'm sorry. It's exhausting being in my head.
That's true. Yeah, yeah, there was something I wanted, I
went after it and I got it.
Hey. I thought about what I want to do tonight,
and I didn't take your feelings into consideration at all.
I want to have sex.
Yeah, we don't have to.
Oh, o-okay. And then after that, we're gonna watch Star
Trek
That's fine. Wait, you mean just the Star Trek... Actually,
I don't care.
Um, I picked it. You're the one who told me
to stop being such a satisficer all the time.
Well, this is what we're having for dinner. You can
eat it or not. I don't care.
It's my house. I'm tired of being told where I
can and can't sit.
Don't take this the wrong way, but that was even
more exciting than the sex.
Well, to work. Just trying out a different route.
Well, if you don't approve of my driving, too bad.
This is the new me. Get used to it.
How is that different than the old you?
Well, all these years, I-I was afraid to say what
I wanted. You know, even at work, you know, there's
things I want to accomplish, but I didn't want to
ruffle any feathers or step on any toes.
Always wanted to be the principal investigator on a plasma
physics study.
I'm serious. You know... I'm gonna put together a proposal
and tell President Siebert this is what I want to
do. If he doesn't let me, there's plenty of other
universities that will.
Of course you don't want me to do that, because
you like it when you're successful and I'm not.
So, I spent the whole day putting together this proposal,
and tomorrow I'm gonna tell President Siebert that this is
what I want to do.
You didn't even open it.
Hmm?
Aw. Let me help. Don't.
Well, big surprise. You can't stand the idea of me
succeeding.
Well, I'm not gonna let them say no. If they
don't want me to quit, this is what it's gonna
take.
Yeah. It's like you said, I have to go after
what I want, and if I can't get that at
Caltech, there are plenty of other universities in the world.
Well, I don't want to, but if that's what I
have to do...
You said I shouldn't worry about your feelings.
Fine, you want to talk about it? Let's talk about
it. I-I'm not loving my job right now. And this
is something that would make me happy. Don't you want
me to be happy?
Okay, I know this seems scary, but I put together
a strong proposal. It's good for me, it's good for
the university. They're gonna give it to me.
I'm sorry, President Siebert, but I'm not taking no for
an answer.
I'm serious.
Really?
Great.
I did not.
Well, I-I didn't quit. I said I was going to.
I walked out the door and started crying. You know,
"Oh, my, God, oh, my God, oh, my God, what'd
I do?" And then he called me back in.
He did not.
President Siebert didn't want to lose me. Even though they
couldn't make me a lead investigator on a plasma team,
there was an opening for a co-lead on a photon
entanglement team. How cool is that?
It's really cool.
I almost got what I wanted, and it never would
have happened if you hadn't almost believed in me.
Oh, please don't make me decide another thing.
Give me a minute, I'll think of something.
No. No, no, no. I-I went to SoulCycle with her,
and my legs hurt so bad, I... literally can't stand
up.
Hey.
I give up.
Sure, what's up?
Wow. Well, that's not gonna sit well with the Nobel
Committee.
Relax, he said it's not you.
No, no, I agree with Bernadette. If Pemberton cheated, maybe
he shouldn't have a career in the first place. There's
plenty of people that didn't plagiarize.
Aw, I love The Scarlet Letter. Th-That's where I got
my taste for bad girls.
Can't believe it. Sheldon loves telling on people when they
break the rules.
He hasn't changed. Last week, when the vending machine gave
me two bags of chips, he called my mom.
Well, it ruined my day. I had to talk to
my mom, who, by the way, is-is polyamorous now, so
that's fun to think about.
Yeah, but what if they don't win? Uh, Pemberton and
Campbell have done an amazing job of associating their names
with super-asymmetry. They have all the momentum right now.
Maybe it is ours.
Well, i-if Sheldon and Amy don't want to expose Pemberton,
that doesn't mean someone else can't do it for them.
They'd never have to know.
They deserve the Nobel. I'm not gonna let two frauds
steal it from them. And if that means getting my
hands dirty, so be it. What's so funny?
Great, thanks.
What if I look at it and decide not to
use it?
Thanks.
What? Nothing.
Uh, no, you are.
You're not doing anything wrong. That's the point. I'm doing
it.
Well, so is you and Amy not getting the recognition
for your discovery. And if that means I have to
do something shady so you don't have to, I'm okay
with that.
Uh, well, let's see, her plane gets in at 3
No-- it's fine, she likes to take a cab or
a shuttle. That way she can meet people.
Yeah, she always says that a stranger is just a
person whose emotional weak point you haven't found yet.
You can't pick her up. It'll make me look like
a bad son.
Fine, I'll pick her up.
This is crazy. I can pick her up by myself.
How was your flight?
Well, babies do that.
Hey, on a completely unrelated note, um, you know, if
you'd rather stay at a hotel, we wouldn't be offended.
Really? It's just, normally, you stay at a hotel.
No, no, no. I-I invited you to stay with us.
Yep. I'm happy, you're happy... everyone's happy.
Yeah, I-I'm actually the colead.
Oh. Yeah, sure. Uh, if you want, you can come
tomorrow.
Good night.
Yeah, clearly, one of us is dying. Come on, her.
Yeah, all right, you've had enough.
And this is a high-pulse laser with a BBO crystal.
It's pretty cool. It emits photons in discrete bursts.
But...?
Oh, I don't know. It's just, usually there's a "but"
followed by something that makes me feel bad.
Ha! I knew there was a "but"-- wait, what?
Here you go. Light cream, no sugar.
She wrote that in a birthday card once. I keep
it in my nightstand.
It made me really happy. We haven't always had the
easiest relationship. But, well, looking back, I guess you were
just trying to push me to be the best version
of myself.
Only Fridays and my birthday.
This has all been work to you? Hanging out with
me and coming to my lab, I... I thought we
were enjoying each other's company, but it was just research.
I can't believe this.
Of course I'm angry!
I am so stupid. I-I actually thought my mom was
genuinely proud of me. It turns out, she's just using
me as research for her new book.
If you like her so much you can have her,
because I-I'm done.
Why?
Oh, my God. When am I gonna stop trying to
win her approval? E-Every time I'm around her, I-I turn
into this needy little eight-year-old boy.
I know that, it's just... after all these years, you'd
think I would have learned.
Penny, can I have a moment alone with my...?
No, I'm not calm. You really hurt me.
It doesn't matter what you intended. What matters is the
way you made me feel. Actually, the way y-you've always
made me feel.
Yeah. And get comfortable, because i-it's a long list.
You know what? It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter, you're never
gonna change. If I want you to accept me for
me, then I guess I'm gonna have to accept you
for you. So... I forgive you.
Too bad. I forgive you anyway. And I forgive myself
for taking so long to do it. Oh, my God,
that feels so good.
What does?
Thank you.
Black and strong, like Luke Cage.
Well, he did say if he fell asleep, we were
allowed to slap him awake.
Wait a minute. Why do you get to do it?
Well, you can't just call it. You have to earn
it.
No one has earned it more than me. You have
your whole life to smack him around. This is my
time.
It's not a volleyball. I can handle it.
Oh, oh, yeah. Do it in slo-mo. I want to
see his cheeks ripple.
No.
There's an infinite number of possibilities.
Oh, my God!
Right. Spit actually flew out of his mouth.
Quirky.
I don't know. Earl Grey?
Buddy, I-I know it all feels overwhelming right now, but
I promise you, things will settle down.
No. Why?
Wow. Amy, you look amazing.
My fault. I was out of Earl Grey. Sheldon, that
was really rude.
It's just a haircut and some clothes.
He won a Nobel Prize, and his wife looks amazing.
Okay, you need to focus on the positive. You won
a Nobel Prize. I slapped Sheldon. A lot of dreams
came true today.
because we were afraid to upset him.
I'm-I'm done enabling him. Like, this is his spot and-and
the thermostat has to be set to his comfort level,
even though he doesn't even live here anymore and I'm
always chilly.
Why would-- Yes! To accommodate Sheldon! And what-what about this-this
thing? Why is it here? I'll tell you why. Because
it was here when I moved in, and, for no
earthly reason, he forbade me to touch it.
You know what, I will.
This might be the glue talking, but that was a
very pleasurable 3900 and a half hours.
What kind of DNA is this, anyway?
What went wrong?
Let's just let it dry.
Don't slam the...
You pick up your dresses?
Was Amy suspicious when they had to let your dress
out?
Someone's gonna figure it out. Why don't we just tell
people?
I have. My head is wrapped.
Excuse me, but if I recall, you're the one who
went out drinking with Sheldon, then came home and attacked
me.
Yeah. I was helpless.
So... do you wanna?
Mm-hmm. We'll see about that.
Go on. You first. Go.
We got this.
Hang on. I've-I've got an idea.
Cool.
She's not sick, Sheldon.
I promise you're not going to get what she has.
He thinks you're sick.
Well, if we don't, he might try and jump out
of the plane.
Are you kidding me? You just found out that a
woman who has loved and cared for you for 12
years is pregnant, and all you can say is you're
relieved that she's not gonna get you sick?
How about congratulating us?
Well, she didn't, now she does. And just so you
know, we weren't gonna tell anybody so we wouldn't upstage
your big day.
You are a selfish jerk. To hell with you and
your Nobel Prize.
No, but still, a-after all these years, after all the
crap I've put up with, you'd think just this once
he'd care about someone else's feelings.
What?
Really?
What?
"It"?
We'll join you.
They'll have pickled herring on the plane.
Yeah. I was thinking that, too. As angry as I
am at Sheldon, I still want to see him win
that medal.
The university prefers "quirky." Hello. Hey. It's Howard. Oh, us,
too.
They're gonna stay. The kids are fine. Bernie's parents took
over. Really? Oh, poor little guy.
Really?
