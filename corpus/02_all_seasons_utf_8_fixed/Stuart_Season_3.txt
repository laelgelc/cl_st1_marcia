Hey, Sheldondon, the new Green Lantern figurine's coming in tomorrow.
Want me to set one aside for you?
All right, I won't set one aside for you.
Okay, I'll set one aside for you.
Yeah, he lives around here. Big gamer.
Oh, I'm sorry, did I rob you of the opportunity
to stumble onto that for yourself?
All right, Raj, looks like you're teamed up with die,
Wil Wheaton, die.
I believe so.
Everyone has a different theory.
Nest of snakes.
That was fun.
Hey, guys. What's going on?
Oh, well, no problem. I was thinking of closing early
and going home, but let's face it, that's just a
slightly smaller lonely room filled with comic books.
Yeah, he's, uh, over in the graphic novel section. Built
himself a little nest.
Uh, Pennyy?
Is everything okay?
Uh, Sheldondon told me you and Leonardard were having a
fight?
Oh, good, good. I love you.
I'd let it go.
We meet again.
Well, you might want to mark your Google calendars. Stan
Lee is coming to do a signing on Thursday.
No, just a regular comic signing. My uncle is his
dermatologist and Stan's doing him a favour.
Oh, hey, Pennyy. Wow. Hi.
Nothing. I'm just getting ready to close up and head
out.
Oh, yeah. Big night tonight. Gonna share a can of
tuna with the cat.
Not even my cat. I just feed it. Some nights
it doesn't even show up.
Sure, yeah, name it.
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't have his phone number.
Mm-hmm. Wait. I have his address.
But I can't give it to you.
I don't know. Just chatting. You're looking at a guy
who could very well get stood up by a stray
cat tonight.
Mm-hmm. Wait.
Maybe we can make a deal.
I will give you the address if you go to
my cousin's wedding with me.
I kind of have to. The cousin who's getting married
is the cousin I usually go to weddings with.
Sure. What the hell.
We'll tell people he's your cousin.
You guys still on for bowling tonight?
Oh. Ouch.
Hey, Pennyy! And you guys. Albino Bob couldn't make it,
so I brought a substitute. I believe some of you
know Wil Wheaton.
So, we're all clear on the bet and the stakes?
Ouch again.
I, um, I want you to know that even though
we're on opposite sides, I, I bear you no ill
will.
Mmm, mmm. People from opposite sides often have good relationships.
You know, Romeo and Juliet, Tony and Maria from West
Side Story, what's-his-name and the big blue chick in Avatar.
I'm gonna bowl now.
Wil, you're up.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah, I'm telling you the Match.com chicks are
much looser than on eHarmony. You know, I, I gotta
call you back. I won a bet, and it's time
to collect.
