Coming. Yup, that’s good. Wine glasses should have handles.
You heard what I did?
Oh, my God, I screwed up everything. I hurt Leonard,
I hurt Raj, I mean, what is wrong with me?
I feel like two totally different people, Dr. Jekyll and
Mrs. Whore.
No.
I’m… I’m sorry. What does this have to do with
me?
You know, I’ve done this before. In kindergarten, I was
supposed to marry Jason Sorensen at recess, but by the
time my class got out there, he was already engaged
to Chelsea Himmelfarb. So what did I do? Hung upside
down from the monkey bars, let all the boys see
my underpants.
You know what? Let’s get out of here.
Somewhere where no one’s seen me naked. We may have
to drive awhile.
Can I stay at your place for a few nights?
Yeah, sure. Yay!
Sounds great.
Yeah, I’m gonna go pack a bag.
You know, I don’t even know what the point of
me staying in L.A. is. I haven’t gotten a single
acting job since I moved out here. The closest I
came was last month, I got a callback for a
hemorrhoid commercial.
I know, right? Maybe I should just move back to
Nebraska.
Why not?
How did you know I was here?
Thanks.
So, hi. What’s up?
Oh. Gee, that’s really sweet, but the thing is…
Look, honey, I was really drunk and made a huge
mistake last night. We should’ve never slept together. It’s what
ruins friendships.
Come here. Just listen to me. I want to go
back to the way we were before. You know, friends.
No sprinkles.
Thank you.
Oh, God. Did you pull some weird Indian crap on
me?
Oh, you did, didn’t you?
So, we didn’t actually…
Oh!
Of course I won’t. No, I won’t.
Sure.
No.
Also no.
Yeah.
Hmm.
Okay. Raj, wait. Thank you for being my friend.
Mm-hmm?
Hi. You guys have a minute?
Okay. Um. Well, I already talked to Raj, but I
wanted to apologize to the rest of you for, you
know, everything.
Hey, what you doing, Quick Draw?
Anyways, I wanted you guys all to know that I’ve
been taking a really hard look at things and come
to the conclusion I have to stop kidding myself. I
suck at acting. It’s time for me to move back
to Nebraska.
Yeah.
I don’t know, maybe teach acting. Oh, sorry. Hold on.
Hello?
Shh! It’s my agent, it’s my agent. You’re kidding. Oh,
my gosh. I can’t believe it! Really? Oh, I’m so
excited, thank you, thank you so much. Okay, bye. I
got the haemorrhoid commercial! I start Monday.
Oh, hell with Nebraska. I’m gonna be a star!
I don’t think so, Mom. Not today.
You don’t know the half of it.
Rose-scented Preparation-H for women?
Shh! Here comes my joke.
Sittin’ pretty.
Oh, it’s no problem. It’s actually kind of nice. You
reading, me reading. We’re like an old married couple.
I don’t have iced tea and snickerdoodles.
I want a divorce.
It’s great, isn’t it?
What name?
Oh, all right, well, I’m glad you like it. I
mean, I still can’t get over the fact someone just
threw it away.
Yeah, it was just sitting on the street. I paid
a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it
up here.
What is wrong?
Sheldon, take it easy.
I went into this marriage with so much hope.
Yello.
Okay, relax. I took off the slipcovers, had them dry-cleaned
and then fumigated the cushions.
Yeah. It’s cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot
Pocket in there.
Why don’t you give it a try, Sheldon?
Why don’t you just admit you overreacted?
What’s up, buttercup?
Nope.
What’s the word, hummingbird?
No.
What’s the gist, physicist?
Pretty cool, huh? Probably would cost, like, two hundred bucks
in a store.
You’re kidding.
And now me.
And what’s that?
No, it’s completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent
you. He put you up to this.
Really?
My God, Amy, that’s really crappy of you.
Yeah! Letting Sheldon use you to manipulate me? I thought
you were my friend.
I can’t even believe this. You know, maybe you should
just go.
What’s wrong?
Wait. Get up, get up! Swear you won’t tell Sheldon
what happened!
Yeah, sure!
Ooh, me.
Thank you all for this high honour.
All right, I got to go to work. I’ll walk
down with you.
Okay, I’m not driving him.
You’re a brain scientist. Can you explain to me why
a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?
Really? For a wedding?
Aw. So handsome. Like James Bond.
Oh, sweetie, guests don’t normally wear corsages to a wedding.
That’s more of a prom thing.
Put the corsage on her.
Ames, hi. How was the wedding?
Come in, let’s talk. Do you want a glass of
wine?
Okay, I’m sorry, what exactly happened?
Oh, God, did he make a move on you?
Yeah, I’m sure he’ll be okay.
So, um, what are you gonna do? Do you want
me to talk to Leonard, let him down easy?
Yeah, my bikini region is fine.
Oh, the poor guy’s so lonely. We should set him
up with someone.
Well, hello? She’s married.
Okay, so future grief-stricken widow is the one to beat.
Um, Howard, can I see you for a minute, please?
Uh, no, that’s not it. Just come with me, please.
Um, Raj, there’s someone I want you to meet. This
is my friend Emily. I know her from my spin
class. Raj, relax. She can’t hear you. She’s deaf.
Oh! Look at you guys just hitting it off. I
am so good.
Mustache is looking good there, Sheldon.
Is Raj out with Emily again?
Wow, can’t believe he has a girlfriend.
You’re kidding.
Oh, of course not. She wouldn’t do something like that.
She’s deaf.
Handicapped people are nice, Leonard. Everyone knows that.
Wait, hang on. Doubles. Roll again.
What do you mean, vastly wealthy?
Well, so how much is that?
Okay, so he’s got money, and it’s a few gifts
and a car.
What? He paid off her credit cards? Damn it, I
could’ve dated Raj for a couple months. But I, I
wouldn’t have, because I’m not that kind of girl. We
should really talk to Raj.
No. I’m the one that introduced him to her. I’ve
got to say something.
You’re engaged to my friend.
I can’t believe you’re engaged to my friend. Oh, here
she comes.
Hi.
Um, can we talk to you about Raj?
Okay, um, gosh, how do I start? Um, see, Raj
is kind of naive. I mean, he hasn’t dated a
whole lot of women. And I’m concerned that, without meaning
to, you might be taking advantage of him. You know,
by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive things.And
I.. I… Howard, focus. Tell her what I’m saying.
Okay, wait…
We didn’t mean for it to be an ambush. Just,
it’s kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf
people. And hey, since when are you so chatty?
Raj, come here. This girl is trouble. I mean, what
kind of relationship is it where you buy her gifts
and she gives you sex?
Okay, come on. You know you can do better.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
I don’t have feelings.
He is cuter now that I know he’s rich.
I know, I know.
Oh, I’m so sorry. I wish I could make you
feel better.
What? No!
Here you go, boys. I’ll pick it up when you’re
ready.
Oh, and don’t cheap out on the tip. We all
know you’re loaded now.
Wait, what is going on?
No, no, no, no, I didn’t forget. Um, there’s this
cat in a box and until you open it, it’s
either dead or alive or both. Although, back in Nebraska,
our cat got stuck in my brother’s camp trunk, and
we did not need to open it to know there
was all kinds of dead cat in there.
Wow.
My God!
Cheers.
Wil Wheaton is Sheldon’s mortal enemy.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.
Oh!
No, I was there that day. Sheldon threw his back
out handing him that book.
Okay, why don’t you just tell him you made a
mistake?
Well, that, that’s good. I’m glad you came to that.
But before you do, let me just ask you a
big picture question.
Are you a hundred percent positive you love and want
to marry Howard Wolowitz?
Got it. Just had to check.
Mrs. Cooper. Hi!
Sheldon, you didn’t tell me your mom was coming.
Good, good.
Oh, fine. You know, it’s been a while. I’m getting
back out there.
Well, it’s super cute on. That top has paid for
itself in free drinks like ten times what it cost.
Oh, they don’t always get to ride the roller coaster.
Sometimes they only get to spin the teacups. Now I’m
going out tonight. Would it be crazy to ask you
to look at the outfit I’m going to wear?
Ooh, maybe a little Rodeo Drive.
This is like the worst Hollywood tour ever.
Hey, they have wine here, don’t they?
Okay, um, hey, God. What’s up? Um, I’m good, but,
uh, it would be a big help to my family
if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth.
But no cops. Be cool.
Oh, Mrs. Cooper, it smells so good.
Hey, guys.
Oh. Yeah. That’s gone. It’s a rough month when Halloween
and PMS hit at the same time.
What’s with him?
It’s open.
Yeah, sure, come on in.
Want some mac and cheese?
Glass of wine?
Okay, well, I’d offer you Halloween candy, but that’s gone.
So, what’s up?
Oh, my God, that’s where I know you from.
All right, what’s going on?
Yes.
It’s okay.
Okay, good, because there’s this one guy I used to
date who’s about to be force-fed wine and cheese if
he doesn’t get to the point.
Yeah, probably.
I’m sorry, go ahead.
Did you guys do it?
Oh, look at you, you bad boy. Did you tell
her about Priya?
That’s gross.
Well, good for you.
So sleep with the new girl and lie to Priya.
All right, then break it off with the new girl.
If you like this girl so much, why don’t you
just end things with Priya?
Leonard, you’re looking for a way to sleep with both
women and have everybody be happy about it.
What does your gut tell you?
So, Bernadette, how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?
Yeah, and cap sleeves? U-u-uh.
Okay, that time you looked at me.
All right, who wants to go to my apartment and
look at bridal magazines?
Through no one’s fault, Sheldon, we’re leaving.
Thank you. Where’s Sheldon?
Why?
Okay, look, this is her first time being a bridesmaid
and she’s just getting a little crazy with it.
Yeah, and she keeps trying to figure out if our
cycles have synced up so we can call ourselves the
Three Menstra-teers
I know. Me, too. We’ll talk to her. Hey, wait,
how did she find out?
What do you tell him?
No. All your little secrets are fine.
Hi.
Well, look, we just wanted to apologize for not bringing
you with us the other day.
Look, come on, Amy, look, let us make it up
to you. We’ll have a girl’s night, we’ll do whatever
you want.
With-with loofah mitts, no hands.
Yeah, we feel awful.
Oh, come on, Amy.
I don’t really want to.
Hi.
I never gave you a friendship bracelet.
No, you made that for you, I want you to
have it.
We are really sorry, and we were trying to think
of some way to show you how much we care
about you.
Yeah, sure, sure. Vegas is fun, too.
Sorry.
Okay, yeah.
What do you think?
Oh! Bernadette, you look beautiful!
Give me a minute.
Oh, Amy! Get the hell out of here!
Oh, God. Amy!
Hey.
Yeah. I’ve got eight pounds of salmon that’s about to
go bad. Do you know how to cook it?
Damn it. Should have liberated the iffy chicken. What are
you and Professor Fussyface up to tonight?
Haven’t you seen that movie, like, a thousand times?
Oh, Leonard.
Well, I’m going to take myself out to a movie
tonight. You want to go?
What do you mean?
Oh, it’s not a date, Leonard. It’s just a man
and a woman hanging out, and not having sex at
the end of the night.
What is that about?
Really? On top of everything else, you’re afraid of birds?
So movies, yes or no?
Great. I’ll see you later. And remember, he’s more afraid
of you than you are of him.
No, I was talking to the bird.
Oh, hey, if we hurry, we can make the new
Jennifer Aniston movie.
Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston movie has Jennifer Aniston, and
she’s not building a dam.
Okay.
You pick plenty of movies.
But come on, that is a great movie, and it
starts in ten minutes.
No, you don’t.
Okay, so while we were going out, how often would
you pretend to like things just to have sex with
me?
You’re kidding.
Okay, we were going out. You were going to get
sex anyway.
No. No woman would.
All right, fine.
No, I was thinking how come they get to leave
and I can’t.
Uh, no, thanks.
I just eat the little crispy ones you don’t like.
To get sex.
All right, I’d like an order of fries.
Oh, sorry.
What you writing there?
I Hope Alex Gets Crabs
Oh.
Oh. Penny. Nice to meet you.
Oh, no, no. This isn’t a date, no. Right?
So have you written anything I might have seen?
So it is an amazing documentary. They need the electricity
from the dam, but at the same time they want
to preserve the environment.
Oh, yeah. Sure. Just one sec?
What’s up?
What am I doing?
No, I’m talking to him because he’s cute.
Yes, he is. With his dorky T-shirt and his little
hipster glasses.
Yes, but when you’re tall and have great cheekbones, you’re
doing it ironically.
You should.
Good! Go! There are some girls right over there. What
are you waiting for?
Hey. Sorry I ditched you.
Oh, no, no. We said we were going to hang
out, let’s hang out.
Oh, he had to leave.
Huh? I’m sorry, get what?
No, no. I want to know what you told her.
Oh. Okay, I see. So while he was telling you
things, did he mention he owns not one, but two
Star Trek uniforms?
Yeah. Wears them. Not just for Halloween.
Okay. Then I’ll return the favour, and I won’t tell…
Laura that half the dirty movies you own are animated.
Did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?
A… S… Take me home.
Okay, I’m not innocent in all this, but you basically
called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass.
All right. Thank you. I’m sorry, too.
Way off.
I don’t know. Up until the last part, I was
kind of enjoying take-charge Leonard with a little backbone. Picking
the movie, knowing what he wants, a little cocky.
Yeah.
Ooh. Maybe I like it.
Good night, Leonard.
Well, ladies, we killed the bottle.
Okay, don’t judge me. So, what do you want to
do, go to the movies, go dancing, lay down for
a little bit?
Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was
pregnant with me, and I turned out just fine. Hey,
look, I have peach schnapps. Thank God.
What’s wrong?
Amy, little vixen. Just working it under all those layers
of wool and polyester.
Oh, she doesn’t have a boyfriend, she has a Sheldon.
So do you like Stuart?
Okay, look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon, but you’ve been
with him over a year now. If it’s not going
anywhere, what does it hurt to look around?
Yeah, for what it’s worth, engaged people can look around,
too. Lot of options out there.
Who do we love?
Who do we love?
Who do we love?
Hello, Sheldon. Come on in.
What’s up?
I’m sorry, what?
God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?
Okay, listen to me. Playing games is not gonna help
get Amy back.
All right, honey, let me tell you a story. There
was a guy I liked, and I never told him
how I felt. Eventually, he started going out with someone
else, and I always regretted it. Do you see where
I’m going with this?
Mm.
You’re not the guy.
I call everyone sweetie.
Look, Sheldon, all I’m saying is strap on a pair
and go talk to Amy.
Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy.
Yeah, I heard you. I got red.
You should probably drive.
Hi. Did Sheldon change the Wi-Fi password again?
Okay. If you can’t get me to stop eating your
food, what makes you think you can get me to
stop using your Wi-Fi?
Sure.
What’s yours?
Basketball Pope.
What are you gonna do about your bully? Are you
gonna see him?
All right, well, what do you think he wants?
Hmm. That’s too bad. We could have spent New Year’s
Eve waiting for the ball to drop.
‘Cause when I wear it, it’s a shirt. So, what’s
Howard doing tonight?
Oh, terrific. High school quarterback against four mathletes.
Hmm, he’s not crazy about needles, but if you get
him to go jogging, it’ll just pour out of his
nose.
Oh, that’s awful.
Wow. You poor thing.
Oh. I don’t know. I guess my school was a
nice place. We didn’t really have bullies.
No, we weren’t really like that. I mean, look, we
played pranks on each other, but it was never mean.
Like, okay, this one girl, Kathy Geiger, got really good
grades, so we blindfolded her, tied her up and left
her in a cornfield overnight.
No, it was funny. Everyone laughed.
Uh, probably. It’s hard to say. She kind of had
an ear of corn in her mouth.
What? I was not a bully.
Anyway, I’m really sorry I made fun of your stutter
in high school.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, God, just finish the sentence. Okay, well,
I’m sorry you feel that way. Bye. No one wants
to hear my apologies.
That’s easy for you to say. You weren’t just called
a b-b-b-b-bitch.
Both.
I actually knew that.
Ooh, I can’t do that. If I stand over a
steaming pot, my hair just goes boing! What else could
I do?
Okay, come on, I don’t even have my own house,
I’m going to build one for someone else?
Oh, my God, that’s perfect. ‘Cause I have so many
clothes I don’t wear, and they’re just taking up space,
and I go shopping to buy more stuff and I
have no place to put it. This will totally fix
that.
And helping people.
Ah, I feel just like Mother Teresa. Except for the
virgin part. That ship sailed a long time ago.
Yeah, well, I bet her laundry room wasn’t down five
flights of stairs. You know, giving really is better than
receiving. I used to think it was such a cliche,
but it seems to be the… oh, look at these
cute jeans someone just threw away.
Yes, to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut.
Come on, they would be so cute on me, and,
ah, they go great with this sweater!
Then sit in the car and keep it running.
Come on, yoga top. Mama needs a new yoga top.
Wait, wait, wait, guys, just hang on.
Look at us. What are we doing?
You know, this is wrong. Let’s put everything back. Here.
Ooh, look who’s out on a date. Pasadena’s favourite power
couple, Shamy.
So, are we celebrating anything special tonight?
That is so hot.
So, are we ready to order?
Sheldon, what is wrong with you?
Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you
acted like it was no big deal.
Honey, she’s upset. You’re her boyfriend. You have to at
least try to be excited by the things she’s excited
by.
Well, just smile and think about koalas.
Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like
to you when I say stupid stuff.
Okay, I don’t think Amy wants a pocket watch.
Still saying stupid stuff. Ooh, does she like bracelets?
Trust me, we are not a couple.
Fine, go ahead.
He’s in trouble with his girlfriend and needs to buy
her a present.
Ooh, are these real diamonds?
Eight o’clock. Sheldon, that pocket watch is ridiculous.
I said, hey, want to come over and hang out?
Hi.
Okay, he wants to talk to you.
Sheldon, you’re up.
Okay, look, he bought you this.
You look beautiful.
Why, you guys going somewhere?
You mean, like a date?
Um, o-okay. Sure.
Just a sec. Too much?
Okay, just hang on.
Uh, about two years ago.
I don’t know.
He’s not dying.
How about this?
Yeah, okay, no.
Absolutely not. Look, we’re just gonna have dinner and, you
know, see how it goes.
What?
Okay, he is not dying.
Screw it. I’m not gonna make a big deal out
of this. It’s just dinner.
Amy, stop it. Oh, God, I’m so nervous.
I know, but we’ve finally gotten to a place where
we can hang out without it being weird. And what
if something goes wrong? Then what?
Oh, that’s a good question. How about awkward?
Yeah?
Okay.
It’s Penny.
Okay, uh, let’s see. I’m from Nebraska, and ever since
I was a little girl, I dreamed of moving to
L.A. and becoming a movie star. Anyway, after four years
of acting lessons and waiting tables, I’ve done a haemorrhoid
commercial and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling
alley. So, you know, dreams do come true. Your turn.
Wow. Can they?
Bat-signal? What are you, some kind of nerd?
What does that mean?
You are so funny.
Leonard, this is nice. I’m so glad we did this.
Whoa. Not so fast.
Leonard, you know I will always have feelings for you.
What?
So?
How would you say it?
It’s the same thing.
You’re overthinking this.
Yes, you are. You always overthink things.
See, this is where everything goes wrong, when we talk.
Hey, I went out with this guy TJ for eight
months, we never talked. To this day, I don’t even
know what TJ stands for.
Do not overthink this.
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.
No talking.
Well, that was fun.
You hung in there, though.
So what do you want to do now?
I don’t know, it’s complicated.
Okay, it’s just, at the restaurant when you said you
wanted us to be together again, it got very real
very fast and I panicked.
Well, what if we do go out and I do
something stupid and dump you again?
Come on, be serious.
So we don’t tell people we’re back together?
Well, we don’t really have to pretend.
Okay, great. Hey, I just remembered. I still got one
of your inhalers.
Yeah, I was gonna throw it away, but I just
couldn’t.
Here you go, guys, let me get you going with
some water. You need menus or you know what you
want?
No, that’s okay, Bernadette. Sometimes these things just don’t work
out.
Wow, you’re like a dog with a bone, aren’t you?
Is the point that you don’t know when to let
something go?
Yeah, just hang on, Sheldon. You know why we can’t
be together? Because you always have to be right.
You know what? I just realized I’m on a break.
I’ll get someone else.
Mind explaining to me why you were being such a
jerk at the restaurant?
No, the plan was to tell people we decided to
stay friends. That’s a little hard to do when you’re
always being such a tool bag.
The hell do you think you’re going?
Yeah, kind of, yeah.
What do you mean?
That’s because you overthink everything.
Why, you guys going somewhere?
Uh, have you thought this through?
Well, it’s a little late for me to start saying
no, isn’t it?
Sorry, just remembered I’ve got to stop by the drugstore.
That was a really nice dinner. I’m glad you asked
me out again.
You see me all the time. You sure you just
don’t miss the sex?
I have. You are not wrong. I just think if
we’re gonna try dating again, we should take things slow.
Okay, well, maybe not that slow.
You know, just for fun, let’s say I’m not.
You mean like a beta test?
Seriously, do I not get credit for knowing beta test?
All right. Let’s give it a shot.
Okay. Good night, Leonard.
Uh, we’re not counting this as a date, are we?
Bug report
Even Doctor Who.
Well, thank you. I’ll see you tomorrow.
What’s this?
Well, that’s quite a list you got there.
Oh.
Yep.
Yep.
It’s open.
Yeah, hang on. Let me just finish this chapter.
No, I can’t. Reading books is a big part of
my life now because, you know, we’d have more fun
things to talk about if I read more.
Two Weeks to Rock Hard Abs.
All right. Terrific. Well, let me just go find a
pair of shoes that aren’t so tall. We wouldn’t want
you to feel like you were out for a walk
with your mommy.
Yeah. Oh. Here’s my list for you, right there.
This is amazing. How did you even get this idea?
Okay, you’re kind of really great.
Okay, bug report. I just complimented you. You should take
it and shut up.
And stop apologizing all the time.
All right, let’s shoot stuff. You want me to show
you what to do?
Wow. You are cute when you get all gangsta.
No, you’ve got a Reebok with a gunshot wound and
an ouchie on your pinkie toe.
Well, thank you for a really cool evening.
Things are looking good.
Good night, you.
What does that mean?
Sheldon, that’s not what girlfriends are for. Although, you don’t
use them for what they’re for, so what do I
know?
Oh, good, your power’s out, too.
Because last month, I sent the electric company a Starbucks
gift card, an apology note, and a few snapshots of
me in a bra.
You know, I got some candles in my apartment.
I’ve got wine at my place and some bubble wrap
we could pop.
You know, in Girl Scouts, Tammie Dinisha said you could
do that with panty hose. Boy, was she wrong. Anyway,
you want to make out?
Okay. Do you want to make out slow?
Ugh. Well, lucky for you, there’s nothing else to do
right now.
Aw.
But he’s sad.
I think he misses his little buddy.
Hey, guys, the building manager said the reason the power
went out is someone went down into the basement and
just pulled the main breaker switch.
Leonard’s Day?
I’m so glad you talked Howard out of having your
wedding invitations in Klingon.
Why wouldn’t you?
Ouch.
You know, I’m a big believer in breaking bad news
to a guy when you’re in bed with him. That’s
how I told my high school boyfriend I slept with
his brother. That’s how I told his brother the same
thing.
Oh, sweetie, that’s what sex is for.
Hey, you.
Yeah, I didn’t have any quarters, so I’ve been sneaking
stuff into other people’s loads all day. Hey, if I
tell you something, will you promise not to tell anybody?
What? That is not true. Bernadette wants a pre-nup.
So you’re saying if I became a famous movie star,
we got married, you wouldn’t sign a pre-nup?
I think about a lot of things. I think about
us getting married, I think about us breaking up. Once
in a while, I think about how I didn’t leave
a note on that Mercedes I dinged in the parking
lot last month, but then I have a glass of
wine and it passes.
Well, tell you one thing, if I ever do get
married, no Klingon invitations.
Hey, what are you guys doing here?
No and no. Everything okay with you and Bernadette?
You and Amy? Good?
You know those girls text me every detail of their
lives as it happens.
All right, Howard Wolowitz, listen up. You sign anything she
puts in front of you, because you are the luckiest
man alive. If you let her go, there is no
way you can find anyone else. Speaking on behalf of
all women, it is not gonna happen, we had a
meeting. And you, a grown man fainting at the sight
of a little blood.
A little something? Oh, it… what, this is huge.
Oh, no, Amy, I haven’t done anything.
Okay.
Wow. I-I don’t know what to s… Wow.
Do I like it? Wow.
Oh, my God. Hang it. Wow. Um, you know, I’d
have to go get a hook and nails and a
hammer and…
Oh, look. You, huh, you just, you got it all
right there. Wow.
So big.
So ugly. What am I gonna do?
Is there any chance I’ll learn to love it?
All right, it’s got to go.
How about I tell her the painting makes you feel
jealous because you’re not in it?
Well, I guess I could take it down and put
it up when she comes over, but it’s kind of
heavy.
I cannot believe you’ve never seen Grease.
Good night, real Amy.
Bye.
Ah, okay. Let us take you off the wall. Out
of sight, out of mind. I wish.
Sure, sure. Enjoy. I mean, get it back to me
when you can, or, you know what, actually, you keep
it. It’s just going to be my gift to you.
Bye.
It’s right over there.
I have no idea. That is weird.
No. No, no. It’s just, it’s a little big.
No, come on, you’re not an idiot. Look, just help
me put it back up.
Oh, Amy, come on.
I came to say I’m sorry.
Oh, Amy, please.
I know.
You’re right. You’re absolutely right. I should have been honest
with you and told you the gift was too much.
I don’t think you can put a number on how
much one person likes another.
Amy, come on…
Three gr… Oh, my God! Look, look, Amy, all you
need to know is, you are my friend and I
don’t want to lose you out of my life.
Grab your hammer.
Okay, look, I didn’t want to say this, but the
real reason I took the painting down was because it
made Bernadette very jealous.
Yeah, th-th-th-that’s what it is, so…
Huh, I try.
Well where are we going?
Well, what about Bernadette?
How’s that?
Now?
Yeah, okay. That’s, uh, that’s good.
Mm.
Yeah, good call.
You’re talking about the painting, right?
You know, Sheldon, I used to cut my brother’s hair.
I could do it for you.
So, if I move my horsey here, isn’t that checkmate
and I win?
Well, is it or isn’t it?
Well, no, I mean, your king is trapped. He can’t
go here because of my lighthouse, and he can’t go
here because of my pointy-head guy.
So did I win or not?
Oh, hey. Sorry, Sheldon, I’ll move.
Okay, what just happened?
Uh, sweetie, are you all right?
Okay, I’m sorry, I don’t understand.
You know, Sh-Sheldon, sometimes it’s nice not knowing what’s coming.
I mean, look at me and Leonard. We went out,
we broke up, now we’re trying again. We don’t know
what’s gonna happen.
If I were you, I’d be worried that a girl
who’s never played chess in her life just kicked your
ass.
What the hell?!
Why did you get bongos?
Oh, Leonard, it’s three o’clock in the morning. I don’t
care if Richard Feynman was a purple leprechaun who lived
in my butt.
Where are you going?
All right, Sheldon, this craziness has gone on long enough.
Please come home so I can cut your hair.
All right, honey, look, we’ve known each other for a
long time now, right? I’ve taken you to Disneyland, I
kicked a bully in the nuts for you, I sing
you Soft Kitty when you’re sick, you’ve even saw me
naked once.
It was a long story. Anyway, Sheldon, I promise I
know what I’m doing. Please let me cut your hair.
Almost done.
Well, sorry, I don’t know any dirty jokes.
Okay, what do you think?
Ha, told you. Okay, I’m just gonna clean up your
neck a little and then you are good to go.
Okay. Okay, yep, we’re all done now. It’s just, it’s
good. Let me just take that away from you. Okay.
You are welcome. Yeah, I’m gonna have to move.
You don’t have to check with me. Do whatever you
want.
Really, what were you hoping for?
Okay, I’m an actress. Ask me again.
Whu… the entire weekend? You mean I wouldn’t see you
at all? But I ju… No, no, I knew what
I was getting into. You can’t put a saddle on
Leonard Hofstadter. Oh, my, is it getting hot in here?
Ay, papi.
An acting choice.
Choo got a problem with that, papi?
Sorry, Stallion. Your weird friend Giraffe is here.
Gummy bears? Thank you.
Not a chance.
All right, sweetie, I’m not going to get involved in
your relationship.
Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see
if there was a ladybug in it.
Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see
if there was a ladybug in it.
What’s that?
Amy, what’s wrong?
Well, I know he didn’t cheat on you, so what
happened?
Who’s Armin the miniature horse breeder?
I would have thought at a miniature horse show.
Mm.
Sure, I get that. I mean, he’s your first boyfriend
and all.
Yes. On purpose.
Well, sickly is the new sexy.
Mm. You know, Amy, sometimes when you’re in a relationship
with someone you really care about, the sucky part is,
it leaves you open to getting hurt.
That’s hilarious. No.
Oh, come on. They’re playing one across the hall, we
should, too. Okay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a
quarter off the table, and if it goes into this
cup, the other person has to drink. Then you get
to go again…
Wow. Yeah, b-beginner’s luck. So, now I will drink this
entire cup of beer, and you will go again and
we can… uh… all right. So, yeah, okay, now I’m
gonna drink this entire cup and then I’m going to
drink another one… Okay, seriously, stop. What the hell?
Whoa, whoa, give me a second to catch up here.
Hold on.
Wars.
Star Wars. They get all cranky when you mix the
two up.
There’s absolutely no difference.
All right. Let me give you a little girlfriend 101.
Usually the first move out of the gate is you
withhold sex, but that will work better after Sheldon hits
puberty. So, I’d say give him the silent treatment.
Hmm.
All right, then we’re gonna have to go with an
oldie but goodie, making a scene.
That’s why you’re lucky to have me. Back in Omaha,
there are two different restaurants I’m not allowed into. Both
Chili’s.
Yeah, you pick that bone. You pick that bone clean!
Ooh, burn!
Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to her family,
and you stood her up, okay? Look at this adorable,
smushy face. Smush, smush, smush, smush.
No, Sheldon hurt you.
Oh.
Sheldon, she doesn’t want your stupid…
And that’s how a girl makes a scene. I’m sorry,
sweetie. You’re right. You deserve your weekend. Come on, Amy,
let’s go.
I’ll let you hold my hair while I throw up.
Oh my God, I love this chicken.
Okay, you’re right, I eat your food a lot. How
about this, you can raid my fridge any time you
want.
He’s bringing me. Who are you bringing?
Hi, you guys got a minute?
Well, I was thinking about Sheldon’s little joke the other
night about me eating all your food.
Anyway, I got a little residual cheque from my commercial
and I thought, hey, how about I get the guys
a little thankyou to pay them back. So, Sheldon, ta-da!
Uh, from Stuart at the comic-book store.
Yeah, it was fun, I walked in and two different
guys got asthma attacks. Felt pretty good.
Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper
hug?
You’re welcome. Don’t worry, I didn’t forget about you. Leonard,
I got you a label maker.
Mmm. And, I got you a transporter too!
Oh, that’s great. Let’s open it up and put him
in there.
Why, they’re just toys?
C’mon can’t we just open one up and take a…
Yeah, yeah, my mom gave me the same lecture about
my virginity. Gotta tell you, it was a lot more
fun taking it out and playing with it.
That was weird.
I cannot believe you guys aren’t going to play with
these.
I dunno. I just think it’s a waste. Relax. I’m
just looking at the box.
What is your problem?
Leonard, I bought you this because I wanted you to
have fun with it. I don’t want it to just
sit in this box.
Yes.
What?
I didn’t break it. I, I guess Stuart sold it
to me like this.
You know, I paid a lot for this. Let’s take
it over there and show him.
What is the truth?
Mmm.
Hey.
It’s not Saturday night. Why are you doing your laundry?
Wow, are these Amy’s? Kind of trashy, good for her.
Ugh. Why are you washing Howard’s man panties?
Yeah, yeah, I know, he’s the wheelchair dude who invented
time.
I don’t understand, why doesn’t Howard just introduce you to
the guy?
Well…
I know what it means. And yes, you love correcting
people and putting them down.
Come on, you do it to feel superior. I see
that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead
of whom or thinks the moon is a planet.
See, there it is, there’s that twinkle.
What do you want me to tell you, Sheldon?
Fine, Howard is being mean to you for no reason.
So, I hear you and the lost boys are having
a bachelor party tonight.
Why should I worry?
Oh, come on Leonard, it’s you. What’s going to happen?
I mean, even if there was a stripper, all you’d
do is avoid eye-contact and maybe offer to help her
kid with his homework.
Really? What is the craziest thing you’ve ever done with
a woman? And the time you and I had sex
in the ocean does not count.
Well, have fun tonight.
Yeah, there is.
Yeah, we labeled them stop and go.
Okay, show’s over.
I don’t care. Ask her things like are you going
to take Howard’s name? Not who’s going to sit on
who?
Nice. You know, you should totally get BernadetteMaryAnnRostenkowskiWolowitz.com before someone
snaps it up.
Oh, that’s cool.
Amy, remember when we went over things that would be
helpful and things that wouldn’t?
Not.
Well, if that’s what you like, I’ll take you to
the comic book store, the place is full of ’em.
Well, a little. You hear stuff.
Well, I was gonna, but I didn’t think it would
go past the first date. Then, when it did, I
thought for sure it wouldn’t go past you meeting his
mother. Definitely not past the two of you sleeping together.
I mean, the warning signs were there, this is really
on you.
Please come out, Bernadette. Let’s talk through this.
Amy.
Hey.
Well, I don’t think she wants to talk to anyone
right now.
Yeah, sure, I guess.
Oh, my God, Howard. That’s the most beautiful thing I’ve
ever heard. And it came out of you.
Oh, what the hell.
What’s with the robe?
No, you’re not.
If you want to do something, you can help me
fold this sheet.
Hey, you.
For the record, not your worst opening line.
B-Before I do it, if you’re a cop you have
tell me, right?
Okay. What’s it supposed to… Oh, my God, this is
so freaky!
Okay. Me, me, me. Ready? Leonard, I am your father.
Oh, Mm. Hey, you know how we’ve been taking things
slow?
Well, I’ve been thinking, and maybe I’m ready to take
things a little faster.
Mm-hmm.
You know, just-just one thing. Look, we’re in a really
great place right now, and I don’t want to do
anything that will make stuff all weird again.
Okay. Oh, and just a heads-up, mm, since the last
time you saw me naked, I got a Cookie Monster
tattoo. The acceptable responses when you see it are awesome
or nothing.
Who says something like that right in the middle of
sex?
Okay, well, they sure as hell don’t say that.
No, the heat of the moment is, ooh, yeah, just
like that, not will you marry me?
Why, so you can crawl under the covers and go,
hey, baby, want to go look for houses in neighbourhoods
with good schools?
You can’t take something like that back. I mean, what
are we even supposed to do now?
You’re kidding.
It’s not funny.
Hey.
Yeah.
Okay, you, too.
Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it, too.
You’re right. No.
Yep.
Yep.
No!
Amy, you look great.
It wasn’t a real proposal.
Good move telling Sheldon.
Hey, I know tons of people who got married in
Vegas.
Yeah, I mean, not to the same people but…
Oh!
Well, that’s easy. Anyone can go online and get ordained
as a minister. I know a piercing parlour where, for
a hundred bucks they’ll marry you and stick a wedding
ring through any body part you want.
Okay, I’ll, I’ll go. Howard and Bernadette, I know you
two planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding,
but when you’re in love, it doesn’t matter where or
how these things happen. It just matters that you have
each other.
Problem?
Oh, grow up.
Well, he started it.
By the power vested in us, by the state of
California…
We now pronounce you husband and wife.
Did I miss it?
I can’t believe it. This whole time, a small part
of me thought he was lying.
