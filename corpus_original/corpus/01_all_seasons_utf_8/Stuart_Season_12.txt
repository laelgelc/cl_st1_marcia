 Hmm. Haven't really thought about it before. But he doesn't need a baggie, because he just blasts the poop with his heat vision.
 Oh, I've thought about it a lot.
 Oh. Okay. Bye.
 I-I don't know. We kissed a little at the wedding, and it was great. But we haven't really talked about it since then. So I-I don't know how she feels about me.
 Seriously, do you think I should ask her out? 
 Thanks. You're a real good pal. 
 Oh, yeah. I, uh, asked Denise out on a date, and she said yes. 
 Sorry. I'm excited. I haven't been on a date in a long time. 
 It's also been a long time since I bought new underwear. And I probably should, because these are no longer tighty nor whitey. 
 Hey, Raj, will you, um, smell something for me? 
 I'm trying out some new colognes for my date with Denise. 
 No. I came over here because I need advice, and you've gone out with more women than anybody I know. 
 Which one's Leonard? 
 Ooh, you're good. I bought it at a swap meet. It's actually called "Smells Like Paco Rabanne." 
 I hope so. I really like Denise, and I don't want to screw this up. 
 And that works for you? 
 Okay, I think it'd be best for both of us if I pretend to get a phone call and just walk away. 
 Hello. This is Stuart. Sorry. I got to take this. Uh, why, yes, I'd love to take a survey. 
 Guys, I need to show you something, but you have to promise not to make fun of me.
 Yeah. I was worried about the date so I got my hair colored to make me feel a little more confident, but that just made me look paler, so I-I got a spray tan. 
 I did. You're gonna need some new towels. And a bathmat. And a toilet seat. I'm picking her up in an hour. What am I gonna do?! 
 You said you weren't gonna make any jokes. 
 Oh, but I was really looking forward to tonight. 
 Yeah. I wanted to look my best for our date, and I made a series of bad decisions... ...one of which is hidden by my pants. 
 Do you still want to go out with me? 
 That's a good one. 
 Are you just gonna make fun of me all night? 
 Great. So what are we thinking, Chinese?
 Yeah, I'm in the mood for orange chicken.
 Ah, hello. 
 Ah, it was great. We went to an improv show.
 Coconuts.
 It just came to me. 
 Uh, what are you guys up to?
 You want to see my room? 
 Cool. 
 I'm a butterfly. 
 I'm gonna put them back.
 Oh, yeah. 
 That was beautiful. 
 I was in the bathroom. Guacamole didn't agree with me. 
 Sure.
 It's late. Would you mind if I crashed here tonight?
 Thank you.
 You buy candy in a comic book store, you get what you get.
 Vintage comics in back, vintage candy right here. 
 Would you mind stocking these?
 Ah, cool. Huh. That's me, right?
 I know you're joking, but my flight-or-flight response doesn't.
 Not for me.
 I-I didn't know your roommate was moving out.
 Uh, i-i-it, uh... Flight. Flight.
 Yeah, she was hinting around about it, but I think I handled it pretty well.
 Uh, no. I talked to her after. She said she's fine.
 Come on, pick me, pick me.
 Yes!
 Ow! I'm hit. Ow! I said I was hit!
 Ow! Why do you keep shooting me?
 I-I didn't say I didn't want to.
 No!
 Oh. Uh, oh... Denise, uh, Denise, Denise, Denise, Denise, Denise, Denise, Denise, Denise, Denise, Denise, Denise and me when I was running from Denise.
 Well, it's kind of hard to explain. Uh, you know when things are going great, but you worry that any minute you might screw everything up?
 And at a certain point, the fear of losing her goes away?
 Hey.
 Yeah, well, you shot me a lot of times. That's not even counting the bruises on the inside.
 Let's hope that's all it is. Ah, look, I'm sorry that I freaked out. It's just that things are going so good with us, and I'm afraid that if we go too fast, I am gonna mess it up.
 Um, I got you something. It's a key to my place to show you that I'm serious.
 Yes, so don't ever use it or let them know that you have it.
 Oh. Uh, no. I appreciate it, but seriously, this is all bruise.
 Gently. Ow.
 You okay?
 Great, because you just bought that whole row of Batmans.
 And now you bought Aquaman. Good choice.
 What can I say? I'm a collector.
 Hey.
 Oh, heads up. If that Aquaman feels wet, it's not a gimmick. Leonard sneezed on it.
 Whoa, whoa. You're not gonna cut open a meteor, are you? Have you not learned anything from comic books? Space viruses? Pod people? I sell nothing but warnings.
 Not as dumb as unleashing a plague on mankind, but, hey, what do we know?
 Is it just me or has no one been in the store for hours?
 Huh. Well, that's strange.
 They cut that meteorite open and unleashed a space plague?
 Let me just lock up here.
 Uh, well, if this is a worst-case scenario and we're the last two people alive, we're gonna, we're gonna have to rebuild civilization.
 I can draw. How 'bout you?
 Oh, I didn't know that.
 Ah. You know, it, uh, might also be up to us to repopulate the Earth.
 So... shall we?
 Sorry, we're closed!
 Where are the kids?
 What? No! I...
 What about me makes you think my heart can handle that joke?
 Where are the kids?
 What? No! I...
 What about me makes you think my heart can handle that joke?
 Hey.
 Oh, that's cute. Did Halley draw that at preschool?
 Well, good night.
 And I'm supposed to be living on my own at this age, but here we are.
 Oh, well, I mean, I am an artist. Uh, i-if you want, I could do the drawings.
 Yeah, it'd be fun. And a, a nice change of pace from what I usually draw.
 Well, good night.
 Hey, got a minute? 
 Uh, Bernadette said you weren't crazy about the book.
 But this could be really good for me, you know? Finally get my artwork published. And-and come on, it's a, it's a cute story.
 Are you kidding? The other day in the comic book store, a balloon popped and I threw up.
 No, uh, the only reason the publisher's interested is because a real astronaut wrote it.
 Uh, sure, yes. What-what do you have in mind?
 So, it would just be The Astronaut? 
 Okay.
 So you have superpowers?
 Fruit or naked dudes? Actually, it doesn't matter, I'm jealous of both. I'll see you tonight?
 Yeah, we're gonna do a movie night.
 You're right, I'm sorry. Howard, would you like to come to movie night?
 Oh, she has a roommate, and he's kind of creepy. A-And that's coming from me.
 Hey, when I moved in, you and Bernadette said it was okay if I brought girls over.
 Ready?
 He's a bear, he talks, no one knows why. You're all caught up.
 Well, sure. Yeah, join us. Movie's up there.
 You okay?
 Bet your neck would hurt if you slept in any store. Except maybe a mattress store. I-I'm sorry, but I couldn't sleep at your place. Mitch was really freaking me out.
 Tonight we'll go back to my place.
 With my health being what it is, I try to live one day at a time.
 You're right. It's my fault. When I had the chance, I was scared and... now that I want to, you're stuck with Mitch.
 More than Galactus wants to devour worlds.
 More than Hulk wants to smash?
 We are so weird.
 Look, I was... scared to move in, but that was a mistake because she is amazing and I really want to live with her. So...think you'd be willing to find another place?
 Yeah, I do.
 I love you.
 Oh, yeah, we're having fun. Me, Halley and Denise played hide-and-seek all day.
 Yeah. I found Denise right away.
 Uh, the important thing is she's not there now.
 Well, that depends.
 Uh, how many teeth did Halley have when you left?
 Oh, yeah, that's-that's what I was afraid of.
 Um, well, all right. Um, Michael had a little fever last night.
 Do you want to hear about Halley or not?
 He was running a little fever, nothing to worry about. And Halley, bless her heart, wanted to bring him his boo-boo bear, so she climbed over the safety rail and took a little tumble down the stairs.
 She rolled down the stairs, laughing the whole time. Anyway, when she got to the bottom, there was a tooth missing.
 She's fine! She thought it was funny.
 No, we couldn't find it. We have a theory about where it is, but it'll take six to eight hours to confirm. Speaking of which, where do you keep the spaghetti strainer?
 Yeah, it's Stuart. Bernie's dad gave him a hug, cracked a rib. Yeah. Okay, we'll meet you in the lobby. How long is it gonna take you to get ready?
